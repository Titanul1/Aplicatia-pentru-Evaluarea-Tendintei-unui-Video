@TheRealSniperTf2,"I enjoyed the song and it is built to the brim with truths about our society. A lot of people, from my experience, likes to formulate a thought based on information they learned without grabbing the concept that all information received isn&#39;t 100% revealed. As time progresses, incremental information will be discovered if the individual is vigilant and ready to absorb the information they are oblivious of noticing from their previous experience. Most people, like myself, prefer not to wait and would rather be noticed now versus being noticed some time in the future. People who put contemplative thought with the content they create (e.g. books, movies, etc.) release their media weeks, months, and maybe a year before they release their content for public viewing; yet people without the experience of being patient and will reply based on their current life situation and hopefully learn from their actions if it is a mistake. Their are two common phrases I&#39;m feeling is relatable with my perception trying to gain fame and/or notoriety (clout): &quot;players going to play&quot; and &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot;."
@xcloudyxabc,"I mean she has a point."
@Froggyboba2228,"Yassssssssss ❤"
@M3msjk,Hi
@itsdaksha,"As a long time viewer of Colleen, music is therapy to her and she’s made a bunch of ‘reading mean comments’ video on her channel and I think that’s the idea and vibe she went for. It backfired because people judged her based on this one video (instead of analysing/ knowing her behaviour for years as a subscriber) and a narcissistic boy on the internet (who gets way less views on his personal content lol). <br>Anyway, we have all made mistakes in life as humans, they may not be as public as celebrities go through. Forgive don’t forget and continue living life! The sooner you get out of your bubble of ‘life should be fair’, it isn’t so move on.<br>Glad you’re back Colleen ❤"

@marliegrossman,"Alright, I personally think this was very well said. I do think that some specific addressing needs to be done but her message about taking the proof and receipts and adding to them to gain more views and ruin her reputation was LOUD and CLEAR. Also why does everything need to be shown on this platform?: To gain more views… it’s disgusting and unnecessary to have this drama out for the whole world to see."

@jazmynhermel5259,"Ok I’m done. Leave Colleen alone. Everyone in entitled to their own opinions, I get that. Her Miranda character is supposed to make strange comments..THATS HER JOB. Her content is for adults. Anyways, the rumors are sad..if the rumors that are being spread didn’t come from her or you don’t have concrete proof that she did ANY of that..I’m with her. I have been watching Colleen for almost 4 years. So stop holding her to her past. NOBODY IS PERFECT. How would you like it if someone were to go and TEAR apart your past. Colleen, I am so sorry for these rumors that are not even being told as the truth. I truly love you and your content. Some people..aren’t meant for your content. I love you ❤️"

@TheExtratoastie94,"For what it&#39;s worth Colleen, people who&#39;ve watched and loved you consistently for years will see that this is how you genuinely get your feelings out safely-you use music!! You always have! And anyone who has watched you consistently for years knows your heart, because you wear it on your sleeve. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been misinterpreted to a new generation. I hope you&#39;re able to get some pockets of peace soon."
@Followlostonline,"Colleen, you’re a real person and this whole thing is such a non-issue for so many of us. I wouldn’t even address it at this point if I were you. You’re beyond all of this. You may lose a few followers in the short term. Let ‘em go. Your talent will give you new ones to replace them. So. Please stop all this nonsense - it’s beneath you to participate. I can’t wait for your next “normal” video… please don’t make us wait too long :) Saw you in St Albert with my niece and sister. We loved it. Your show is fantastic"
@EmilyNGA,"I don’t think people understand this video.  It’s very serious.  She’s showing us she isn’t doing well.  Art and music is her way of processing it.  She’s definitely not taking anything lightly. If you know Colleen you know what I mean."

Hate will not prevail! Thank you for posting this! Know that this will only solidify who you are as a person not define you, this will strengthen you and lead you forward. You got this Colleen!!!

@MichellesdesignsEtc,"Yeah she did admit to some things and I don&#39;t know what she could actually say to satisfy people. People do change for the better and also for worse all time as a Christian I see it happening. Should you let your kids watch her I&#39;m not necessarily saying that,  she did say pg13 sooo... and just because you have some screen shots doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not gossip or a rumor....you just have proof of said rumor I mean I don&#39;t really watch her videos and I&#39;ve heard all this blow up about her multiple times!! Here on YouTube... now I&#39;m not saying that nobody shouldn&#39;t ever boycott or avoid but sometimes cancel culture is rough!! dang! Certain political circles cancelled Roseanne for stupid reasons and I&#39;m certainly not a Roseanne fan (ugh!) But they did her dirty and for a nothingburger of a reason (you guys do know that she IS a liberal) she was a big dem back in the day but y&#39;all canceled your own 😅🤦‍♀️ over nothing gag at a nat swallow a camel... 💯 and YouTube has filthy disgusting rap music videos which are vulgar cuzzing almost naked women and if your child has a smartphone and it&#39;s not very restricted or Mom watching over shoulder these kids CAN access that cr@p sorry saying f every 4 seconds doesn&#39;t make me amazed sure jan &quot;art&quot; and also promotes gun violence the kind not protected under 2A ammendment rights. No you can&#39;t shoot people for stealing your drugs or your car or lady etc. Or because they looked at you funny no that&#39;s not 2A rights lol YouTube themselves censors youtubers for the wrong reasons. 💯 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ like I&#39;ll make something up they censor women in bikinis because it promotes body shaming even though they never shamed anyone. The real reason to censor that is because Children don&#39;t need to see borderline p0rn 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂🧐😓 but ohh unrealistic expectations is what gets em&#39; 🤡 and don&#39;t get me started with stuff like with pewdiepie a whole nother can of worms! I&#39;m like soo... maybe some things he said weren&#39;t cool but let&#39;s hear why you think that first! 👀💯 some were worse than others... I don&#39;t keep up with him but I know some of the drama (thankfully not all of it)😮  like the one with paper guns... but hey we have them rap videos with at least what looks like a genuinely real gun but hey it gets a pass they&#39;re a celeb with tons of 💰💰💰💸💵💶💷💲 so hey they get a pass and besides YouTube will say &quot;it&#39;s not our responsibility to safeguard your kids&quot; only when it&#39;s like card board guns with pdp then we actually took your child into custody 😂  exaggeration but you get my point! It&#39;s like there&#39;s a reason my Mom didn&#39;t take me to a Roseanne stand up comedy and let me go on stage😂 it&#39;s almost like hey she knew what Roseanne was about &amp; if she did she could probably guesstimate what Roseanne would go on about 😂 (shocked pikachu face!!) But she never said I know I will write to these venues and cancel Roseanne back in the 90s and call her a certain kind of offender and trust me Roseanne isn&#39;t on my Mom favorites list and we think they did her wrong for nothing... ohh wait you mean she voted for a certain orange guy. And suddenly she&#39;s a staunch conservative 😂🤣🙄🧐 puhlease! No I&#39;m not going to start binge watching Roseanne  but man!"
@user-vt4oe3vt4s,"I love colleen, I grew up watching her. I don’t think she is a groomer or predator. She has always been my favorite person, I like that she has made this into a song, I get bored watching people apologize for 30 minutes and not mean a thing. She has turned this accountability and song into something else that will take the pain away for her and makes it a little light hearted. She has talked to her fans, but a lot of tubers call their fans their “best friends” and Colleen actually made initiative to talk to them. I see where she is coming from with that, Colleen is just the aunt that is trying to be there for the kids so they have someone safe to talk to.

@BMG12366two,"I mean... Tbh... I don&#39;t know much about the situation, but everything she says here seems extremely genuine. That&#39;s just my take on it. It seems like everyone is just shitting on her for just doing this in music form, when in reality, it&#39;s much mote genuine than 90% of any Youtuber&#39;s apology/explanation video."
@kathryn.obvious7699,"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don&#39;t care and say &quot;she&#39;s only responding because she got caught&quot;. If she never responded, you guys would say she&#39;s guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she&#39;s a liar and say that you&#39;ve already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying &quot;don&#39;t believe everything you see&quot; because guess what, there&#39;s two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I&#39;m not going to bash her before I&#39;ve even heard her side. This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying, I swear people aren&#39;t even fans of her and are bashing on her. Chill tf out."

When u posted ur pregnancy announcements and ur old house tour after u bought ur new home i cried with u. Most recently the death of ur chickens. U cant FAKE being a good person. We all make really shitty mistakes. When i first heard about this drama i started watching one of those videos and i stopped almost immediately. I just wanted to know what was happening. I simply didnt believe and i still dont that u harmed anyone intentionally. I hope u make it thru cuz u are one of the only people i still watch faithfully and it breaks my heart. Mostly cuz i feel like i know u and i know how much this is hurting u. I can only imagine the anxiety and stress this is causing. Ur poor fingers must be worn raw. Chin up friend. ❤"

@Kaitlyn-jg5vm,"Ya’ll can’t be mad that she didn’t apologize when you’d just make fun of her for that too. I don’t think you REALIZE how much things like this can ruin a persons life in almost every aspect. I’ve been a fan of Colleen’s for almost 10 years and have even met her. She’s genuinely the sweetest human I have ever met. She agreed that what she did in the past was weird and you have to keep in mind that she was very young herself when she started Miranda Sings. She has grown so much and learned so much, as we all do. Please think about how this is affecting her and her mental health. She has said all that she feels she wanted to or could to defend herself, it’s not right to make fun of her for defending herself. She’s not just some youtuber that everyone wants off the internet. She’s a wife and mother. Think not only about her, but her family."

@shanadavis3001,"I will admit my bias because I’ve been watching Colleens YouTube videos for almost 6 years now for context I never really liked Miranda Sings. I’ve frankly never watched Miranda sings content unless it was for Colleen because I liked Colleen. I always loved their family’s channels and I watched Rachel, Colleen, and sometimes Chris. The whole Ballinger family that’s what I grew up with. Only recently had I started watching Colleens Vlogs less consistently Because I’ve been busy with college. However, when all of this came out about Colleen a few years ago, I remember believing the person that said it and when Colleen originally addressed it everyone universally came to the understanding that she had made a mistake. The irony is all of this drama that’s coming back up is it is the same thing that people tried to cancel her with years ago. Now, by no means, am I trying to justify any of her actions, but what I’m saying is for this video specifically, I appreciated the apology. I have grown up, feeling like I’ve known Colleen and known her personality, and she always turns to art when she doesn’t know how else to express herself. that’s some thing I quite liked about her because I end up doing the same thing in my personal life. The point I’m trying to make here is this apology is perfect for her in my opinion because this is an example of who Colleen is and how she deals with problems. I think it’s beautiful frankly, when an artist pours their heart into their work. I know some are saying that they would prefer for her to have been more professional in this video, but contrary to popular belief, when all of this came up years ago, she did address all of this and made a formal apology years ago. So now when people are bringing up the past again and trying to cancel her with the same old thing, I think this is a perfect way to respond and I understand if you disagree that’s all right. I could be wrong, and I could be blinded by my own nostalgia but it’s my opinion. Colleen if you happen to see this comment, just know that one of your fans has forgiven you, and still loves you.❤<br><br><br>Also, just bring a little bit more perspective into this. I really don’t appreciate you guys calling her a pedophile because I am a sexual assault victim. I was raped by a 30 year old man when I was six years old he was a pedophile. Colleen making a few out of taste jokes and weird comments does not make her a pedophile. Please don’t label people with such horrific terms when they haven’t done anything to deserve it."
@MaryLauner,"People suck, its ok. Keep your head up"
@juanitatorres8551,"To the people who are attacking her “ grow the hell up”, it’s not her fault. She just wanted to connect with her fans, and to the people who feel “trauma”, you shouldn’t have responded or even dm’ed her . To the people who feel “trauma” grow the hell up and admit you shouldn’t have done that like a crazy fan. This cancel culture’s is the stupidest thing ever. Why can’t people make mistakes like what humans are supposed to do. To the people who don’t make mistakes, your parents must of had y’all on a chain and the belt in there hand."
@AussieOzzies,"Cancel culture sucks! Everyone makes dumb mistakes in their lives. Unfortunately, for people well known, it ends up being smeared everywhere. Yes, she made a few silly mistakes but it was very clear she was never &quot;grooming&quot; Adam and didn&#39;t have any sexual interest in him whatsoever. The only people that can throw a dagger in Colleen&#39;s direction are those who have never made a stupid mistake before and I&#39;m sorry to burst your bubble but that&#39;s no one!!"
@user-id5lq1oq8w,"I hate cancel culture so much😩 she’s corny but she’s not a bad person… i don’t understand why people today feel so entitled and feel like the world owes them something. Every vid that came out about her was such a fucking reach."
@sarahjayneroe8859,"I support you in this. You already apologized and addressed the things you did wrong years ago, so why should you apologize again for that, and additional things you don&#39;t believe you did? I&#39;m glad to see you aren&#39;t letting cancel culture win and bowing to their demands. Please stay strong against it and don&#39;t cave and delete this or apologize when an apology is not deserved."

I am so glad you made this video because I was so worried about you and just know to take as much time as you need.

@collinheldenbrand,"Although this might not be the best way to come back and apologize, if you actually listen to what she’s saying. She is saying sorry and she is apologizing. And although this is a little strange, and I don’t fully understand the situation. I feel like she went into detail and is actually trying to apologize and tell the truth. Y’all will just ignore and make jokes and not actually listen to her, and then call her out for being a bad person. Maybe listen, you might actually see that she is trying."

@kassidymcveigh6156,"Hi Colleen❤️ and who ever else will read this! <br>I am so glad you made this video and I think you need it to. I have always been a silent fan. I rarely comment, but I watch every single one of your videos not exaggerating. I started watching what other people were saying about you and I began to question if it was true, but then I would see some wild things. For example, one creator made a video about you, and he had never even watched you assuming you are a family vlogger when you have said, explicitly you are not. Videos of your past of you saying not so kind things have resurfaced. What irritates me is people refuse to see your growth and the fact that you are an advocate for so many people. You are a best friend to strangers on the Internet who need you when they have nobody else, you’re a mom who reminds other moms that they are strong too, you have have mental health issues and advocate for the fans you love to accept their mental health issues as well and everybody who watches you knows they’re not alone. What people fail to realize is that your fan following is not a cult, we are people who have made mistakes too and admire your willingness to grow as a person and learn new things about life that you once didn’t know. You teach others to open their minds, just as you have learned to. Please never quit posting. Please keep being the inspiration you are , please keep being the amazing mother you are please keep being the fun, kind, creative person you are."

You just wanted people/ your fans to like you and didn’t know the right way to go about it at the time. You were young and made mistakes we all do. Everyone who attends your shows and watch’s your videos need to understand what they are getting themselves into you have always made it clear what they are about and that it is inappropriate and all jokes. <br><br>I just want you to know that I support you,  love you and have missed seeing your videos because I think of you as my friend.

She has three innocent children to be a mother to, and your words are not helping. She didn&#39;t commit a crime; otherwise, she would be convicted of one, but you all act like she raped or killed young children. Im not a Colleen super fan and I&#39;m not invested in this, but I&#39;m old enough to know that all this hate will just break Colleen and her family will be greatly impacted.

You are going through a very difficult situation and I know from experience in my life that when something you love and something that defines who you are as a person gets ripped from you because of a mistake or rumors or hateful people it can be so overwhelming and feel so awful that you start to question who you are as a person and what is your purpose for being here.  Let me tell you in case you haven’t heard it from anyone but the people closest to you,  you are worthy of forgiveness for your mistakes!  You are worthy of love and not just from those closest to you right now.  You have touched many people and done so much good.  Don’t let other people’s agendas and need for gossip define who you are right now!  Let “them” cancel you!  You don’t exist to make “them” happy!  I feel like from being a part of your life for the past few years that the mistakes made in the past are just that, the past!

I wonder if this pain is motivating you to be more creative, I know that&#39;s what happens to me. To me, you singing with your uke is genuine and very creative - you turned your pain into art.

@KristinReneeCreative,"Colleen I hope you’re doing ok. Just know you do have people out there who still want the best for you. You have made me laugh for years, gave me happiness as a depressed tween with no friends, helped others in their journeys to stardom, are accepting of the loser kids and gay kids and weird theater and art kids, outcasted kids, poured your heart into your work, prioritized your fans over your own health many times, you’re talented, and seemingly a wonderful mother, sister, daughter and wife. The way people have berated you, threatened you, and body shammed you over this is so vile and toxic. If the goal for this was accountability, all of those other things didn’t have to happen. This was a smear campaign. I don’t argue with there being inappropriate jokes made, I don’t want to diminish other people feelings about their experiences. This whole situation to me has been more about hurting and humiliating you and tearing apart your character with irreversible allegations that aren’t always presented in a truthful way. Calling someone’s groomer is a very serious and legally punishable thing and implies sexual abuse/relationships or other illegal activity with underage people. It’s not just talking to, joking, interacting with and being friendly with young people or every celebrity, Daily vlogger, YouTuber, Tiktoker, influencer would be considered a groomer. The YouTube community was really just beginning in 2012 and most of these YouTubers we know now had ever had experience on the platform or even much with the internet/social media altogether. MySpace was the first real “social media” and it was very common for larger accounts to communicate with ‘fans’ of all ages in groups and messages and pen pals with younger people like an older/younger sister type relationship. That was how this generation of YouTubers grew up on the internet. Having boundaries with internet followers wasn’t something they knew they needed until they blew up enough that they had probably already crossed the boundaries most have in place today. How are you supposed to know the limitations as an internet famous person if no one had ever been internet famous before? The jokes Colleen/Miranda have made are sometimes inappropriate or even bad taste but never with ill intent never with the intention to coerce, manipulate, or groom."

If anyone has ever really watched her videos and paid attention to the kind, sweet, loving, caring personality that shines from her beautiful soul y’all would see and understand that yeah she made a mistake years ago but is not that person anymore you will see and understand that she has grown so much and only says and does with the best intentions to her knowledge.

But people only want to see the bad and can’t look through one side of things"

@iindyaaaaa,"i’m reading comments and some of you definitely came here to just hate. she said her team do not want her to speak about it, they never said she can’t sing it. she obviously wants to say her part, but her team is stopping it, which is why she turned it into a song. i’m not justifying what she has done, or what others in this situation have done, but you all seem to pick and choose what you want to hear."
@laurascott9850,"Colleen, sending you and your family so much love. The internet has really shown what a nasty place it can be here recently. <br>I know you are a kind, compassionate woman and mama.

There has been PLENTY of time to get her in court.  That has not happened, why?  There is nothing here.  You think you have all this evidence with screenshots. There are two sides to a story.  Quit judging her without knowing all the facts.  Does she deserve to lose her job over this?  If so, why didn&#39;t that happen 3 to 5 years ago?  Why now???"

Listen to her, it would be so easy to just say sorry and let it all blow over but she’s sticking to her truth and being strong in the path that she never did anything intentionally to hurt anyone. People are so mean and run with anything they hear, also that was then and this is now obviously we have ALL grown to know what is right and what is wrong. Back then so many things were accepted that aren’t now but we still drag things up from the past for absolutely no reason? These are real people with feelings in a messy situation it’s none of our business to determine who’s right and who’s wrong in this, they all need to move on and heal."

Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them.. what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it, volunteered to be on stage? The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later.  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle..  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse... I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually"

Being mean and saying things that are not nice will not fix anything. She has children now, she would never do anything like that, stop making up lies. If you believe those lies and don’t like what she ‘did’. Then leave. She is trying to make videos doing what she currently loves, we know her intention, she is simply trying to make us happy. Showing us her lives, her kids growing up, giggling, laughing, singing, living her life. Just because she is famous does not mean people should be angry at her. If you haven’t made a mistake on your life then there must be something wrong with you. And if you made a mistake years ago, how would you feel to have millions of people going after you, saying mean things, making up lies. Be real people, think how you would feel and start being real! Now if you don’t like Colleen anymore, leave. That is fine with her I am sure, probably better. Go."

@jayannlugod4597,"At the very beginning of collen&#39;s yt career, she has been sharing with us how introvert, shy,loner  little girl or even up to now she is. This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now. So if we come and think of it, she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone. We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes. Our generation is far different from their&#39;s, it is nice to see that young people are making a change, but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if it&#39;s the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better."

@ashlynnmacdonald5197,"I’m so sorry you are going through this. We are all human and unfortunately you can’t take back what you did in the past.  These people have worse things they did and are trying to make themselves feel better by ruining someone’s life they don’t even know. Anyway happy to see you but sad for the reason❤"
@laurenrobson1140,"Colleen hasn’t used her music because she is trying not be disrespectful if you have watched her it’s how she gets her feelings out through her music! I’m so sorry people have a past but the only thing different between you and her is you don’t film your entire life so people can’t point out everything you did wrong!!!"
@ashes8808,"Seeing your face on my feed today just made my little girl&#39;s entire summer. We love and miss you so much, Colleen. <br>Stay strong!"
@reinaprocee,"I&#39;m trying to understand this timeline of events...<br>Three years ago she was accused of inappropriate contact with underage fans. One in particular came out and made a video. She took accountability and apologized for her inappropriate choices and has grown and changed since then. <br>Meanwhile the person who made a video was doxed, bullied and harassed.<br>Now more corroborating evidence about her inappropriate contact has come to light and people want her to apologize again? I don&#39;t understand that. She has already apologized. If anything it&#39;s the people who bullied that one person who came out with the allegations that should apologize. <br><br>I think that maybe singing this wasn&#39;t the best move, but she is a human and people are emotional and flawed and that&#39;s kinda ok. I don&#39;t know what glowing saint person you want to see on here, but I always felt like she was honest about her missteps and mistakes and took strides to learn from them.<br><br>I&#39;m 40 and it would kill me if people still judged me based on who I was 15 years ago. Anyways. That&#39;s my two cents."

@hconf,"You take a whole bunch of mistakes over many years and call her a bad person… we all have made mistakes. Colleen is so kind hearted and would never intentionally hurt another. She has apologized and explained herself over and over for these things over time… enough is enough. Colleen is right that it’s all for clout and views. If you don’t like Colleen, please leave. This was a special place for the rest of us before all this."
@daniellehughes1522,"Yall are really just looking for someone on the internet to be upset with.. go get involved in your local communities and get mad at the people/politicians who are actually hurting humanity.

I cant see the side of you they are trying to put out and even so i can tell even if some parts you admitted were mistakes and you owned up to it. You are only human colleen. You are not who you were and even then i do not think you were like they are trying to insinuate: people grow and learn at any rate and you are no difference and do not deserve to be torn apart. Pleas do not let them destroy you and although its hard when it seems like everyone is against you- they arent. Im not and i do not think you are horrible. I dont know what happened in the past but it is the past. One thing i know is you have three beautiful children that need their mommy. Show them your strength and how you persevere through troubled times. Please keep your head up."

@emmajoneagle6980,"I don&#39;t know the entire story with what kind of messages she sent to fans. But what I do know is it was forever ago. There&#39;s way worse well-known people still out there. Idk why this apology is hated when she could have listen to her team and not acknowledged anything, but she felt as if she needed to. She&#39;s come so far from where she started, she helps more then she&#39;s &quot;hurt&quot; since then. Like she said people say things and everyone feels like they want to be part of something by hating her. Your not just hurting her but the family she&#39;s grown and the loved ones that have to see her in distress. It&#39;s really sad, and I&#39;m not trying to validate anything that she has done. But I&#39;m sure u guys have forgiven friends and family that&#39;s done more then just text people trying to be funny in an inappropriate way. Sorry ur going through this love, I hope u come out on the other side and u have the strength to carry on despite. The internet is a cruel maze of funhouse mirrors. It&#39;s hard to navigate when everything so distorted. But it&#39;s easy to follow somebody else&#39;s lead when they think they know what&#39;s real. Just carry on and you&#39;ll find ur way out of this mess. 🩷🩶You still have fans🩷🩶"

I just think, she has 3 beautiful babies at home that are probably sensing something is wrong with their momma. Everyone has a life outside of social media guys.

@ethanisking84,"Please ignore the allegations. None of them have any merit. We love you!"
@AmberC17,"Guess what everyone. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how or what she said. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if she apologized the way you or anyone else wanted. Shes absolutely correct. No one is going to care what she has to say. They wont believe it anyway. So why not do it however she damn well pleases"
@summererofeyeff5370,"Look, I understand that there have been more than small mistakes made in the past and that Colleen should take a little more accountability for that. However, as she said, people make mistakes at the end of the day, and I don&#39;t think it is on the public to constantly scrutinise her about it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t watch. <br><br>Her actions with fans in the past went over the line; however, that doesn&#39;t mean that she is a terrible mother; I have watched her vlogs since she got pregnant with the twins and didn&#39;t have any doubt about her love and devotion for them. Sure, they are displayed in videos, but what person online doesn&#39;t do that? It&#39;s not only her, and it&#39;s something to look back at for memories.<br><br>Again I say if you dislike it, don&#39;t watch it. I will never understand how people think that it is ok to harass others. She is well aware of her mistakes and leaving harassing comments won&#39;t change that."

You might not be welcomed back in the online community for a while but I wish you only the best and all the love from your close Family and friends and you as a Human being are okay Just the way you are - with all your flaws and mistakes.

Because it was in private.<br><br>I bet you all feel silly. Not silly enough to go against your managing team that apparently told Colleen to not respond at all [wonder why that is].

You should not have been talking to children and you&#39;re not taking accountability. You did this video where you sing about how you feel horrible and then you stopped to talking about how people are toxic and how they don&#39;t care about your apologies. It comes off as high and mighty, manipulative as well as flippant. You would have been better not saying anything because now you&#39;ve made sure that everyone knows you don&#39;t care and aren&#39;t taking it seriously."

She is also a person who is capable of learning and growing from those mistakes. If anyone commenting under this video had a mistake from their past resurface online and then had thousands of people treating you viscously and trying to isolate you, you would be absolutely crushed and humiliated. Have some compassion for your fellow human, mind your own business, and go touch some grass. If you don&#39;t like colleen anymore because of her past decisions, fine, but cut the contact and go find somewhere else to release your negative feelings. A therapists office perhaps? You aren&#39;t the hero/warrior/whatever that you think you are, and that&#39;s okay. Because you&#39;re human, and you&#39;re making a mistake by harassing this woman online for a conflict that has nothing to do with you.

@BrittyBratt17,"Wow, the “self deprecating”, “feel sorry for me”, “it wasn’t my fault”, “it was just a mistake”, REHEARSED SONG?! Are you kidding me?? This is worse than an apology- you actually sat in a room, probably for weeks, to come up with this terrible song to prove that what you did was just a “mistake”? And to make people feel BAD FOR YOU because now you’re calling every TOXIC for everyone actually seeing who the real you is??! Wow. This was bad. Your “feel sorry for me” song didn’t work. All you had to do was just look into the camera and just say “I’m sorry”. Toxic? Girlfriend, you’re the definition of toxic."

I know that the fact that it&#39;s all being brought up again is unfair because now everyone including you has to deal with the shame and trauma of it all again when I&#39;m sure you all had moved on. Colleen, I watch your videos every single day and I&#39;ve watched all three of your babies as they&#39;ve grown. I see how happy and well taken care of that they are and honestly I could never believe that someone who was a bad person with bad intentions could raise 3 of the cutest sweetest happiest babies ever. I can only imagine how you&#39;re feeling these days. Just remember, you will get through this and when you do I, and so many others, will still be here to support you exactly the same way we always have. I&#39;m praying for you and your family.

You have been the favorite parts of my day while I get to sit down with my dinner and watch your vlogs or listen to you and Eric&#39;s podcast. I love you a lot. Since I was watching you in the past and watched these videos or heard these things you&#39;re being accused from in the moment they happened I feel I am justified to say that I don&#39;t believe you did anything wrong. Humor was a lot different back then and you did what you did to make people laugh back then but I feel you understand how things were wrong and you&#39;re not that person anymore. I have missed you a lot. I think you are an amazing person and I will continue to watch and feel like I am your friend. I hope things get better for you soon 🙏 I also hope you can start posting again and you will see that many people are still on your side and supporting you. I love you Colleen"

@Redfern4,"For any fans that are struggling with excepting this. Miranda over the years ridiculed and made fun of her fans. Based off of them being different and trusting her thinking that she accepted them. That wasn’t the truth when that reality was shattered for them somebody that trusted in Miranda it’s probably devastating to them. Please do not trust her with any type of para social relationship. Miranda has showed the type of person that she actually is she talks badly about the people that care most about her. Frankly there’s not even a real reason for it if you are a fan of hers please just take into consideration.that could’ve been you. You could’ve been the one talking to the person that you have looked up to for years. Just to later be thrown away and to really know how she actually felt. Leaving Miranda behind now will just be character growth. No one wants someone like this around and it is deflecting the responsibility for quite literally forcing people into situations they did not want to be in including her fans."

@bbrenduhh,"I know a hurt, angry, frustrated heart when I hear one. It’s not wrong to come to your own defense, it just might not hold the weight you want it to. When I was a teenager my dad told me “don’t do good things that look bad” because regardless of my thoughts or intentions going into things, what will be addressed is what was done. That learning to align my intentions with proper actions is a way to create boundaries of respect for myself and for the people I interact with. I can’t imagine the magnitude of learning lessons publicly online where every mistake can be brought up for all of time. I myself am far from perfect and when my soul is heavy with my own shortcomings I often turn to the quote “I hope you live a life you’re proud of. And if you are not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again”. I don’t wish you pain but in the face of this storm, if you don’t survive the train wreck, I do hope you find a new life on the other side. There are few people with your experience that could be the catalyst and help guide places like YouTube towards adopting policies and practices that could set better boundaries for underage kids"

She has changed certain things because of the fact that yes she’s learned from them and now she’s saying I took up accountability and am taking accountability for my past mistakes, so why do you have to try to ruin my reputation in order to have your fun. I can really tell who has  been a fan for while, by seeing who actually thinks she’s a bad person all of a sudden I know who isn’t. I’ve been watching Colleen not Miranda for like 10 years and I can confidently say that she is not a bad person and I might not know her personally, but her entire career has been based on making people laugh. Adults included, and I don’t understand why people love to think that she’s a monster."

But as soon as I learned more about this stuff happening behind the scenes, no part of me could ignore it (remember that whole mom thing?). This video was highly disappointing. We get that people are humans and are bound to make mistakes. Even your young viewers know that. But to play the victim and not truly take accountability was almost as bad as the mistakes you made. I kinda feel like you <b>thought</b> you were taking accountability in this video but you weren’t. And to add a ukulele in was just poor taste. It would’ve just been better for you to not say anything at all. These kids feel victimized and rightfully so…whether you believe that yourself or not, it doesn’t matter. You cannot take responsibility for mistakes while also playing the victim. It doesn’t work like that. I really feel for the kids going through this. I hope one day it’ll finally click for you. And soon. <br><br>Hopefully Erik is making sure that you have mental health support because no matter what, nobody deserves to be in a dark place whether of their own doing or not because how else can you grow from it."

Discomfort is part of life. So either avoid it or learn to live with it. Our society is so obsessed with being victims, so everyone has banded together to find a way to be victims. Victims are so glorified these days, so people are desperate to victimize themselves. Yep. Colleen messed up. She talked about it when this first started. And we all moved on. Because that’s what you do after you acknowledge and learn from a mistake. You move on. But this victim mob wasn’t done feeling victimized yet, so it was all brought up again. There’s a reason this didn’t feel like an apology. It wasn’t one. She had no intention of apologizing. She didn’t need to. I’m actually impressed at her strength in this video and her ability to finally stick up for herself. Everyone else needs to move on. Period."
@pamelamueller379,"It’s so funny to me how many people don’t even realize that all of these allegations came out a LONG time ago, and you addressed them a LONG time ago, and have changed so much since then.

Colleen you should keep in mind that you&#39;re a mother with three children and YouTube is your main stream of income. This will badly impact you.

Thank you for you time, hope your kids are doing good, and I will be praying for you because I can tell you need God to help you right now. Have a blessed day, please actually apologize. Amen."

We’re supposed to grow from our mistakes, they make us better people for it, we’re not supposed to be completely ripped apart!

@jodibently3651,"Colleen, I have been a follower of yours for years now and have loved watching your family grow. I have always supported you, but i can in no way support this &quot;apology&quot;. To me this was nothing but a slap in the face to the people who were affected by your actions. This isn&#39;t a time to play victim or to try to win over people with excuses. This is a time for a genuine apology. The internet is now going to get ahold of this video and stred you to pieces over it."
@DontCryBoo,"you should&#39;ve listened to your &quot;team&quot; like how do you not realize your  &quot;past mistakes&quot; hurt you fans,  Just because you moved on doesn&#39;t mean they did.

You’ve made a positive difference in my life and I miss watching your videos. There were so many times I wanted to reach out because we have so much in common. I also have a background in theatre and love all the same shows you love. We speak the same language. I know this will sound so corny, but it sort of feels like the angry mob kidnapped a friend.

But here you are making your alleged truth seem like a whole comedic scripted song. I expected so much better from you… You are an alleged advocate for mental health and the truth but here you are mocking your own fans who have come forth with allegations and are suffering with mental health problems due to your wrong doings. <br><br>How hard is it to acknowledge what you have done and caused without victim blaming them for being fans and wanting your attention.

Telling everyone you’re taking responsibility is not taking responsibility.

Was choosing to do this via a song maybe not ideal for some people? Maybe. Does her doing this make her previous mistakes ok? No. But she has said sorry. It may not be in the way you want but she said it. She also has changed.<br><br>Imagine you make a mistake - could be really bad. You might initially recognise it or maybe you don’t cause it wasn’t your intention. Then you have millions of people give their opinion on either the truth or lies that were spread. People insult you, tear you down. You would be crushed.<br><br>She is a person. People have to answer for mistakes, yes. But no one deserves millions of people to berate and curse them and make them feel horrible. Just let her be. Let her recover from the online attacks.<br><br>I believe she is a good person who learns from her mistakes. People are entitled to their own views and opinions but if you have them and they are going to hurt people, think before you talk/type.<br><br>Thinking of you Colleen 💐"

This video doesn&#39;t seem like you, but I guess being put under such intense scrutiny and hatred so suddenly can be shocking and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not in a very good head space. I guess it makes sense that you&#39;d  go on the defensive. For me, personally, it would be nice to see you more fully and genuinely acknowledge the hurt that many of your young fans have felt and are going through. You can&#39;t undo it, and it doesn&#39;t define who you are, but it would be a kindness I&#39;d like to see. I hope you don&#39;t stay bitter and I hope you can find healing too 🩵"

Everyone makes mistakes and over the past few years that I’ve been following you it’s been obvious that you’ve grown and learned a lot since you started doing Miranda and you’re always so careful about the way you speak and taking accountability these days, and that is one of many things that’s made me watch your vlogs almost daily for the last three years or so.

No matter what she says, it won&#39;t be enough or right or to everyone&#39;s standards. She&#39;s wrong if she does and she&#39;s wrong if she doesn&#39;t."

Deflecting and refusing to take accountability for hurting children (while being an adult woman in her 30s), is simply not appropriate.

What happened obviously wasn’t great and they were things she shouldn’t have done. However we do not have all the facts. We are only seeing and hearing a small part of the situation. <br>She also said in this that her PR team does not want her to be speaking on it. So this is probably her way of trying to cope with the situation.<br><br>People can change and I think we should be looking to see how she conducts her self in the future vs what she did in the past. We all make mistakes and do things we shouldn’t. I know if this was us we would want to be given a chance to prove that we have grown and learned from past mistakes. <br><br>I for one will be supporting you Colleen. I am not justifying what you did. Nor am I saying you shouldn’t be held accountable because you should. But I also will be supporting your growth and change. I feel like everyone deserves that chance."

I’m glad you did somewhat bring up some things but barely. No one is perfect including your viewers, the only difference is real people are hurting right now and the right thing to do was fully open up and give them the apology and closure they needed. I was waiting for this video and crossing my fingers you would say something, anything that made up for all the nasty things said and done. I believe people CAN change and so can you, but when you constantly play the victim it’s impossible to support you any longer. I wish you and your family only the best."

So that’s definitely weird…commodifying this…because there won’t be an end to it and people will inherently take it very (too?) far for their own personal gain. <br><br>Seriously…this is a cautionary tale about making yourself and your family a product.

That’s a quality I think a lot of people struggle with. In saying that - I hope you have the courage to know that there are so many of us that love and support you and I hope that people stop attacking and spreading and go do something else with their time - it’s horrible and unacceptable for people to push opinions and lies. <br>Stay amazing Colleen - while the bad voices may be talking a lot - there are still so many who love and support you! 💐"

@graceelizabeth4371,"For those neurotypical people out there and don’t understand neurodiverse people… people with Neurodiversity don’t cope with conflict and we all cope differently. Colleen copes best with music and shes said her version of events and just cause it wasnt the “conventional” youtube apologies you all used too doesn’t make Colleens any different. No one is perfect and believing rumours is the biggest High School shit ive ever seen/heard. So maybe just give the woman space before something happens and y’all be sobbing if ended up dead. So leave your negativity at home 👍🏻 thanks"

@Magencory17,"Colleen, do NOT listen to these young sensitive kiddos. 2023 is a sensitive girly, and don’t let these children and young adults in the comments knock your cheese off your cracker. Us actual ADULTS understand your intent, and we understand that you simply just made some jokes, and content in bad taste, yearssss ago. Shit happens! These little hater kids will also make their mistakes. Their time will come, but hopefully they can learn by yours and my mistakes, and ALSO know how and when to take accountability like a champ, like you just so bravely showed us FANS. Keep on keeping on, Colleen. I promise you, your family, and your career will be just fine! 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼"

@carrotlover7763,"I have done things in my life that I wished that I wouldn’t have and one thing I know is that you can’t change the past; you can only control the choices you make going forward. Cancel Culture doesn’t allow people the opportunity to be accessed by who they are now, just judged by choices made in their past.<br>People may think they know all of the facts about a situation, things can be manipulated and shown in a light by parties that only have a singular goal, to put down others. I am a human and I make mistakes, I don’t know any person who is perfect. My Mother told me long ago that it wasn’t her place to judge, it was God’s.<br>I think we should all show some grace and compassion; stop and think about it, have you ever done something and wished that you hadn’t?"

@asisevapodcast,"I&#39;ve always sensed that Colleen was always walking on eggshells when she spoke, with fear of being called out for the most silly things, because people nowadays will cancel you for anything, she has also mentioned how she is a people pleaser so I always felt like she should stood up for herself and boy did she surprised me with this video/song. I love it, stand up for what you believe in Colleen. We don&#39;t have any right to meddle in your life, and the way these kids are bringing stuff to the public using cancel culture is not the right way of doing things and nothing good comes out of it. So I applaud you for drawing the line on the constant apologies and bowing your head down, and yes you are saying and taking accountability, but there is no right for millions of places treating you and painting you like a monster, because you are not, if you are a monster then the real bad people out there would be what?"

@werschturtle,"Can we all just take min to remember she took the accountably and apologized three years ago. It&#39;s time to move on. The fact it resurfaced with more or less of the same info, doesn&#39;t warrant the need for a new apology. She hasn&#39;t done anything since and no one stepping forward is claiming anything in recent years. People grow and change. Love you Colleen, hope you see you again soon. Much love from NC"
@riannakristina5364,"everyone wants her to make a serious apology video and take accountability but she already did a couple of years ago when this stuff was brought up the first time so idk what y’all want from her - if you didn’t accept it the first time why would she take that route again"

@madiwolff5187,"NOT THE FUCKING UKULELE"
@taylorblair6117,"So, where are the facts exactly? Shouldn&#39;t taking accountability include an apology for &quot;mistakes&quot; when they&#39;ve hurt people, even if it wasn&#39;t their intention? 🤔This is an incredibly disappointing response."
@oliviajohnston6176,"Oh my god LOL"
@riann7707,"You know I can understand how cancel culture is toxic but only when the facts behind it aren’t true. For instance, Jenna Marbles was under fire for her past racist videos but shows she made changes and made a great apology video afterwards. She also hasn’t come back to YouTube afterwards, possibly won’t which is sad because she’s actually very genuine but I can see why she wouldn’t want to. I think it’s better for you to put up your ukulele and stop singing and actually make a video that is genuine and give an explanation for everything, even if it makes you look bad in the past it shows that you’re taking accountability and are willing to change. Better yet leave YouTube to show that you actually care for anything that has happened."

This is having the ego of someone who doesn’t care what damage they have done."
@lbridge2010,"Hey Colleen, I honestly don’t know the whole story, and I don’t really care to. I’m obviously sorry that some people were hurt, but I think that the content you make now is so beneficial to so many people, your past mistakes should not take that away.

@SabrinaTwyla,"Theres plenty of people (aside from youtubers as well) who have changed from their pasts, and become better people, thats how we grow as humans. But most of if not all of them apologize authentically with statements whether it be in person or online. I appreciate the idea behind this personally, as a commentary on apology videos as well, but with so many screenshots and reciepts I think you need to do more than just this. People were really hurt, Colleen. I’m writing this as a previous fan, and person who always looks to kindness and positivity. I think most people know that Miranda is PG-13, but still most of the fans of Miranda are children so it’s not fair to them to be put in situations they don’t understand but adults do. I hope you read this specific comment from a place of caring and love, because as a previous fan I do care about you as a human being. We all make mistakes, but to grow you have to embrace the mistakes. Certain things need to be addressed not defensed. (Also why was this not posted on the main channel?)"

It&#39;s unfortunate that cancel culture has taken over so much that people automatically believe and only see the negative. They fuel it while refusing to look for themselves if people have grown. Sometimes I think they don&#39;t even believe that ANYONE can grow. I&#39;m not even the same person I was a year ago, so why should I think that anyone else is too? People who know you or who have been watching for a long time can see your heart and where your intentions have always been. Know that a lot of us are here for you."

NO ONE is having fun by being on the &#39;toxic train&#39; as suggested by this song. You ruined your reputation all by yourself. I wasn&#39;t even one of the ones treated poorly by you and even I&#39;m disgusted by whatever this is, i cant imagine how they must feel. If you are such a good person then give the people you negatively impacted with your inappropriate behaviour a genuine apology and show them and your fans how you have changed. make changes. You are not the victim here."

Also if this was a current situation them sure these things you say could be true but these are years ago... we all have pasts that we regret or in the moment didnt think anything of it and then realized shit that was not a good idea. So if she owes anyone an apology its the fans that are personally affected not the ones behind screens typing mean comments away"

Recently I have met someone at work who has watched your videos since the beginning like me and we have created a friendship and its because we bonded over you. You put out so much positivity, creativity, and realness to the world and I hope you can continue to do that. We both sat together and watched this and felt your pain through the video and I just want to say I have NEVER commented on ANY of your videos nor any other youtube video lol but I know how much they help so I thought I&#39;d do it even if you don&#39;t see this.

Seeing how many people she has hurt, she just responds with her playing the ukulele and singing? This is how you take acountability for your actions? This is bullshit, man. And I am so sad seeing a person that I really enjoyed watching turn to be such two faced and genuinely manipulative person.

You can make mistakes and be a good person, but that requires accountability and actually feeling sorry for what you’ve done. This is not accountability, this is not feeling sorry, this is pushing off people who are saying (and have proof) that you harmed them for a “joke”. It’s not funny. It’s not cute. You have NOT grown. Making a song victimizing YOURSELF while people have been harmed is the most childish thing I’ve ever seen. You should have listened to your PR team because this is not a good look. There were a million other ways to go about this that would have seemed sincere, caring, kind, etc. This seems genuinely vindictive and awful."

I really think a statement from you should not be in a song (it comes off as arrogant and rude to the people who have been affected). But also I see no type of accountability taken and it feels like you are trying to play the victim. I’m not trying to be hateful or rude, but on top of all this you also chose to try and profit off of this situation by selling a “canceled” T-shirt at your show. Not to mention the tons of evidence that people have of what you would say in the chats to them. I don’t think it would’ve hurt to privately apologized to the people that were most affected in this whole situation and then addressed the public afterwards.

You fostered an imbalanced power-dynamic between you and your fans. You should have known what you were doing. NOW, you need to take accountability for not being the adult in the room. Not in song form. Not while trying to manipulate your audience in the process. Apologize, take accountability WITH THE RISK OF ALL THE CONSQUENCES! You might lose your career!!!

Of course we don’t know everything that happens in her life as she only shows us small parts in vlogs but I choose to believe the best in someone until they’ve proven they’re not worth believing in. If people judged me based on things I said and did 5, 10, 15 years ago then I would be done for. But I’ve grown and changed as I know Colleen has and it sucks that just because she’s well known on the internet she’s the one that gets hated and cancelled. <br><br>Colleen, I really hope you’re staying strong through this.

It is unfair that just because your career is in the public eye that you should not only be attacked for things you have grown from and already apologized for but also be attacked for lies and misconceptions being told about you.

I hope to see more of your videos again, we miss you!"
@samanthakressevich4226,"Perhaps the comments people are saying about you are cruel. But a cute jingle doesn’t negate the fact that a lot of the stuff is on video, not to mention you’ve admitted to lying so a dog was put down and killed. You talked about how you put a animal in a garbage bag. And mistakes happen. Obviously, you’re human, that doesn’t mean you’re deserving of horrible words. But it does mean that the mistakes you made are beyond small mistakes. A lot of the stuff you’ve done is genuinely fucked up and most people wouldn’t do, that’s where the issue lies. It’s a cute jingle, but I don’t think you can really get out of this one unfortunately."

As long as I’ve watched her I know that’s something she would never do to be malicious, I know this woman and she deserves to be heard just as much as they others do. I’ve heard both sides and I feel for everyone involved but it’s the internet and you never know what’s actually happening. Everyone needs to take accountability for what they did or said including her, but in the meantime let’s not jump to conclusions and harass people. Colleen I love you and will continue to support you no matter what, your true fans will always be there for you, just take some time (even though we miss you) and focus on yourself and your family, we’ll be here for you when you’re ready 💛 I will also love these other people involved and hope they do the same thing. Everyone deserves to be heard and in the meantime let’s all just calm down and wait for both sides. After that, whatever decision you make is your decision, that’s totally fine and everyone is okay to have their own opinions.

Through your vlogs you can see that in essence you’re a real human, an empathetic soul, who unfortunately is capable of the human mistake of caring too much what other people think and wanting people to like you. Find me one person who does not crave approval in one way or another, you are not perfect, find me one person who is. You are good, and that is good enough!"

She won&#39;t dare to speak like that to the KIDS that are calming (w evidence) to be her victims, right?) I&#39;m sorry(not), but please don&#39;t come back to the internet. Also, how can she talk about FAcTS WHEN SHE DID NOT GIVE ANY BUT TO REPEAT AND SAY THAT WAS LITTLE MISTAKE?. Was this the reason  Kory’s have the balls to say what he said on his Ig? Lol what a dog"

@tanyademetri,"Well I don’t think you should have posted this and I do agree with you that everyone makes mistakes and you’ve made mistakes but this wasn’t a way to go about it? You should have apologized the conventional way saying that it was your fault. Instead you made it seem as if you did nothing wrong? So that’s a bit twisted. I don’t think you should be getting so many death threats for it but the fact that you can’t take accountability for it and this is the first time of you speaking about this publicly is a shame. I think you need to take a break and just focus on you and your family. I hope all is well with you and even though you haven’t approached this in a good manner you and your family still deserve all the happiness and health in the world."

Why just people bring up the past but spin stuff around it to make you look like a bad person. You’re not a bad person, and the fact that people find entertainment in your pain not even thinking about how you’d feel. Disgusting. I hope you’re doing alright, I’ve missed you and your fun family.

@mella676,"I&#39;ve sat on the fence about this whole situation, I was mindful that there is always two sides to a story. I appreciate that speaking to such strong allegations is frightening and overwhelming and trying to salvage your reputation and career is probably huge for you right now, but this video feels uncomfortable and dismissive. I&#39;m not certain what kind of response I was expecting, but this definitely wasn&#39;t it. Hopefully in time, your legal team will help you speak to this situation better than this song - I&#39;m just not certain this was the right way to go about it."

@vickyvillegasxx,"Girl how the is this taking accountability?"
@ivyleafwinters,"This is really disappointing. I have been a fan since around 2014-2015, and this video is not it. Fine, some of what is being said could be embellished or twisted to make accusations more dramatic, but never in this video did you call out the things that are untrue or dramatized. Instead, you made a song seemingly mocking the people who have made serious accusations against you. You did not give any evidence of things being taken out of context or lied about so how are we supposed to believe that the accusations are untrue when there are screenshots out there that are pretty shocking. Also, girl, this is not taking accountability. Taking accountability would be calling out specifically what you did wrong and apologizing to those parties and definitely not in song. I thought your channel was a safe space on YouTube but now I don&#39;t believe it is."

I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how difficult this has all been for you. It&#39;s not my job, or anyone&#39;s job to judge or condemn you for your actions, accused actions, or really anything. I&#39;m not sure if you are a believer in God and I don&#39;t mean to make this religious, but my intention is to give you strength here. God is the only one to judge you in life and while the voices of media and those close to you are loudly pointing their fingers at you. Please remember something it&#39;s all forgivable. You aren&#39;t a bad person or a horrific person because of your mistake. Just learn from them. I think you&#39;re a beautiful and talented human. An amazing mother who has 3 very lucky babies. You are human and as my sister in Christ I love you and I have pain seeing the world pull you to pieces. Stay strong, find strength in prayer. I promise you it helps. Keep family close and just stay away from media. I&#39;m sure the crows we&#39;ll find someone else to attack soon enough. Keep your head up, shine bright, and remember there is nothing that isn&#39;t forgivable in the eyes of God as long as you seek that forgiveness and learn. Sending you love and honestly a really big hug because I&#39;m sure you need one. ❤"

@Kam-vz4yo,"I LOVE THIS! Colleen, you don&#39;t need to take accountability for the lies of one person. The lengths that wannabe social media influencers go to for followers is disgusting. Especially when that person&#39;s whole public persona is dedicated to destroying another person using past events taken completely out of context. Parasocial bullying is toxic and scary. I hope you and Erik and Flynn and the twins and Kory are doing okay! We&#39;ll still be here whenever you decide to come back❤"

And two, that you are taking responsibility for your actions. Everyone makes mistakes like that a lot. But I have seen more then that over the years. I’ve seen you love, laugh, and be your TRUE self around others. Including us. 😌. Not only that. But also saw you become a mom and teach THREE new kids about the world around them, and I can’t think of anyone else with that many and that young if kids that’s doing as good as you! You created the phase “Haters Back Off” and are sticking with it! And we love you for that. Some people never change or give up or anything! Your one of those people colleen 😘😌<br><br><br>I know you did not have bad intentions. But saying your sorry is the best you can do.

@tinapelletier4788,"Colleen, <br><br>I have been watching you for years. I have enjoyed you, your family, and truly feel like I&#39;m a part of your life. When the accusations came out, I was utterly confused. None of it made sense. It didn&#39;t fit the Colleen that I know and it didn&#39;t seem to add up in my mind as the accusations seemed to be far fetched. Whether there can be some truth to any of them, is none of our business. That said, there are two sides to every story and even then, there&#39;s still more story. <br><br>You are an incredible inspiration to others. Your kindness, your realness, your laughter, your humor, your hair - every little bit about you makes you REAL. So many people on the internet try to be someone they are not and you aren&#39;t like that. These people who are attacking your character and reputation, don&#39;t know the real you. It can be argued that none of us really do, but I believe that a person&#39;s true motives can be discerned early on and you don&#39;t deserve to be silenced, to wither away, to feel this pain and anguish, or to have this level of total disgust and disdain thrown your way. <br><br>Keep pushing through, love. Do not lose your spark, your joy, your creativity, your realness. Don&#39;t let others&#39; negativity cloud your sun. <br><br>I don&#39;t comment much, but know you have support in your corner - even if it doesn&#39;t seem like you do at times. ❤"

As for the people who leave comments and make videos on the topic- you need to get the correct information and I believe that the only way of doing so is watching her videos and knowing how kind, generous and how much she has given back into the community. People need to remember that she is a human and that the internet thrives off rumours and dragging other people down. Why don’t we focus on people who have done genuine wrong, instead of people who made mistakes years ago and continues to work and improve on these mistakes."

If you imagined your children going through what you’ve done to other people’s kids and you still don’t take it seriously, nobody and nothing can help you. Stay away from children, stop talking to children, stop going to children for advice. And probably get offline since you have shown that you can’t resist temptation when it comes to being involved with m*nors."

@macy1090,"Yes everyone does do things they regret, but the things you were doing was when you was in your 30s. Okay but let’s just say you really didn’t realize it was wrong okay fine, there’s always a time to apologize. Apologize to this person in private and then maybe make a video. You would never do that though because you really aren’t sorry, you’d rather block the person and make a passive aggressive video. I’m not one to comment on any sort of videos, but this one really aggravated me."

@MrMunson1980,"With what has been said etc about Colleen, i never saw it as problematic, as she said she is the oversharing aunt, as someone with some years on my shoulders, offending someone isnt your fault, you are not responsible for how they see the world. We all have a different world view, and yes she made a mistake of treating fans like actual people and shared too much,  maybe sometimes inappropriate, group chats get a lil wild and will go to random places sometime, shes obviously seen the tone of the chats and just gone along. Being in the public eye is hard and she thought she could trust these people, as you would trust close friends, obviously not,. Hindsight is 20/20"

I am also missing Miranda Mondayz,terribly. Listening to the &quot;Shower Curtain Bossa Nova&quot; full-blast in my car has helped. I burned the audio of that track to a CD-R. It sounds amazing, as I hear it with other tracks on my commute. <br><br>Please bring your show back to Ohio. To Columbus Ohio, or even better, the theater in Newark ,Ohio ( The Midland Theatre).

I got diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s syndrome recently ( i konw it is not used anymore in the US, but where I live - Hungary -, it is still a diagnosis), and dermatilomania. Your ADHD and dermatilomania struggles are very similair to my experiences as an aspie, with the same skin picking disorder. You show me, that having emotions aren&#39;t a bad thing, and that it is okay to feel our feelings and can also show them to the world. I support you all the way, and if you read this, I wanted to let you know, thatyou matter to me very much even though I do not personally know you, and I cannot love many people<br>love;<br>Lotti"

For me you have in inspire me to do manny things for example make the little moments in time important, now because of you I always try to take everything in and think this tiny moment in my life can be the most important place in time. Anyways I know that this is long so I’m gonna try to end it. 😅 but sometimes i feel like shit sometimes through out my day but I have to keep going in life so I do that. But anyways I really miss you you are like a mom figure to me you understand all of things that can help me in life like having your kids having everything in all different colors instead of having them follow Society rules and having them like the things that their supposed to like, I really wish my parents are like that cuz right now I’m bi but I’m never gonna tell them cuz I know their not really gonna accept me. So when I can to your channel I feel so happy cuz you are my inspiration. So I really miss you so much, I really hope your kids and you and Eric are happy and healthy so I hope you start posting again but if you don’t that’s completely understandable but I hope you do. I will see you soon. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"

@hailsb3536,"Cornball 💀"
@lizziesanders8980,"I understand your intention, I know it may not have been intentionally hurtful or malicious, but you HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND that your intentions DO NOT equal impact. You have to take accountability for your intentions and IMPACT on others and victim-blaming and minimizing what you put children through is asinine. If you want to take accountability, please realize that taking accountability here is realizing you are not responsible enough to have a platform in this way. You have no idea how to manage dynamics with your audience and this proves it."

I live alone, don’t have, anyway you just talking about everyday sometimes seemingly mundane things , for me feels like a friend  chatting to me.  I’m not chatty, but I like chatting and you provide that. I like laughing and you provide that, I sometimes feel sad and you feel sad with me, I even like singing, badly, and you sing with me and Miranda makes me sound like I can 😊.  You mean a lot to many people all ages.  And just so you know, I try never to swear I think you call it cussing, but sometimes there is just no other word to describe how you feel.  This is one of those mole it’s not a haters back off moment it is FUCK the haters.  I doubt you will see this message, but it made me feel good and thank you for helping me feel better all these years"

@Dekiams,"This is probably not the most serious attempt to apologize or take accountability, neither have you really talked and explained the inappropriate messages or actions at shows, which might not put you in a better light. BUT I completely agree that there&#39;s nothing criminal, you&#39;re Miranda character and shows never seemed to be aimed at children, and mistakes don&#39;t make someone a completely bad person if they see the wrong, own up to them, and grow by not continuing them. I think there is a lot to think about for you, adjust, possible genuine and not humorous apologies to be made, and I truly hope for you to continue and eventually for people to forgive you and everyone to move on. Looking forward to your vlogs again! :)"

All you little no life loosers should go ask your mommies for a refresher on how to be a decent human."

You will never be satisfied, you’d rather berate someone until they are screaming for you to stop because an apology isn’t enough. Everyone is sad that Jenna Marbles “disappeared”, but yet you all are the reason why she did, vicious and unforgiving. <br><br>Colleen, nobody is perfect!

@amelia5695,"Hey Colleen<br> I just wanted to let you know that as soon as I heard the rumours I acknowledged it was likely you made a mistake in the past (as you said people make mistakes) BUT I immediately decided based on the information out there and how you seem to live your life now (not that anyone really knows (which is part of the reason I feel like maybe they shouldn’t be so quick to judge…. Annnyway)) that you seem like you’ve grown and moved on. Even if it was an unfortunate mistake that seemed to hurt people, if you choose to lean and grow and change the way you behave, in my personal opinion that’s enough to show you actually are remorseful of your behaviour and there is tons of room for forgiveness. Anyway just wanted to sound off for the people who didn’t jump on the train cuz they see a genuine caring woman in you and we’re standing with you the whole time 👍"
@alwayzjello,"I know you&#39;re probably staying away from the comments, but I hope you can read these comments and that you&#39;re comforted by all the love and support.

I feel you do everything in your power to grow and try to be a better person for others and help teach and educate. You are not purposely trying to cause anyone else pain, ever. I am sorry it has been so hard for you. You do so much good for so many people by just sharing your life with us. Try to remember how many of us also feel alone that you have helped or also have made mistakes or have done something where we think &quot;hey, I would do that differently if I could go back&quot;. Sending you love - you are a good human."

You haven’t done any of those things in ages… yet here they are all still, being “mean girls”, making millions of videos. Gods, one of the videos alone had 20+ ads in it….. It’s pretty clear the true intentions behind this attack.<br>Am I disappointed in some of the videos and texts coming forward from you, 100% of course. Do I think you should be harassed and attacked to the point of ruining your family, life, career? Absolutely not. You were just an idiot who made some mistakes and grew from them. But to blame you for their bad actions or to blame you for parents allowing their children to consume your content… putting that blame on you is wild."

@mallorynicolette,"Colleen, thank you for resurfacing. Thank you for adressing the hateful rumours. Though we have never met in person, I have been following you through everything. Even before I knew Miranda and Colleen were the same person. <br>The realness and light you give off is a gift to all who follow you and to people who have the pleasure of knowing you. <br>I know you have probably been told this many times but my nannie always told me those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. As hard as it maybe to have the spotlight on you in such a negative way, just know your light will always shine through. Just keep being yourself and doing what you love. The world is a better place when you share your amazing self with us. You are one of the only real ones, no staging, no gimmicks, no unrealistic expectations to live up to. You are just a real human, mother, wife, friend and influencer. <br>This too shall pass. I know it’s hard but you are too amazing to give up. Love you ❤"

I&#39;ve been a subscriber for years and years, and have been waiting to hear your side before jumping to any conclusions. I was scared, that someone I loved, related to and looked up to had been lying or faking all these years. I&#39;m still not 100% convinced to either side, but I&#39;m here, still subscribed and still supporting you for the person I truly believe you are. I hope I&#39;m right. And I know you don&#39;t owe us anything, BUT if at some point, when everything has calmed down, maybe you could be blunt about what statements ARE true and not true. Some of the accusations are pretty horrible, and I&#39;m really hoping they&#39;re either false or at least a stretch of the truth.<br><br><br>So, from a friend, I hope you and your entire family are handling this okay ❤ I miss watching your vlogs every single day."

If its not illegal we should be giving people the ability to do better and move on with their life. Otherwise we are sending a message that there is no point and you might as well just continue to be a crappy person its definitely easier, usually not as uncomfortable and wont change people coming after you."

@kokolayna5205,"I have loved Colleen for as long as I can remember. Her and her sister saved my life at one point. When I heard the rumors I cried in disappointment because no way the woman I looked up to the most growing up could do something like that. There is so much proof and so much evidence. Facts or “rumors” or whatever you’d like to call them, there is so much evidence. It may be stuff from the past and it may have been a mistake. But she disappointed a lot of people and hurt a lot of people. I feel bad watching this video because I love Colleen so much but I can’t support it. I won’t support it. I’m proud she took some sort of responsibility. That doesn’t make up for the amount of proof and hurt she caused to a lot of her fans."
