@TheRealSniperTf2,"I enjoyed the song and it is built to the brim with truths about our society. A lot of people, from my experience, likes to formulate a thought based on information they learned without grabbing the concept that all information received isn&#39;t 100% revealed. As time progresses, incremental information will be discovered if the individual is vigilant and ready to absorb the information they are oblivious of noticing from their previous experience. Most people, like myself, prefer not to wait and would rather be noticed now versus being noticed some time in the future. People who put contemplative thought with the content they create (e.g. books, movies, etc.) release their media weeks, months, and maybe a year before they release their content for public viewing; yet people without the experience of being patient and will reply based on their current life situation and hopefully learn from their actions if it is a mistake. Their are two common phrases I&#39;m feeling is relatable with my perception trying to gain fame and/or notoriety (clout): &quot;players going to play&quot; and &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot;."

@M3msjk,Hi
@itsdaksha,"As a long time viewer of Colleen, music is therapy to her and she‚Äôs made a bunch of ‚Äòreading mean comments‚Äô video on her channel and I think that‚Äôs the idea and vibe she went for. It backfired because people judged her based on this one video (instead of analysing/ knowing her behaviour for years as a subscriber) and a narcissistic boy on the internet (who gets way less views on his personal content lol). <br>Anyway, we have all made mistakes in life as humans, they may not be as public as celebrities go through. Forgive don‚Äôt forget and continue living life! The sooner you get out of your bubble of ‚Äòlife should be fair‚Äô, it isn‚Äôt so move on.<br>Glad you‚Äôre back Colleen ‚ù§"

@user-vt4oe3vt4s,"I love colleen, I grew up watching her. I don‚Äôt think she is a groomer or predator. She has always been my favorite person, I like that she has made this into a song, I get bored watching people apologize for 30 minutes and not mean a thing. She has turned this accountability and song into something else that will take the pain away for her and makes it a little light hearted. She has talked to her fans, but a lot of tubers call their fans their ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù and Colleen actually made initiative to talk to them. I see where she is coming from with that, Colleen is just the aunt that is trying to be there for the kids so they have someone safe to talk to.

@kathryn.obvious7699,"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don&#39;t care and say &quot;she&#39;s only responding because she got caught&quot;. If she never responded, you guys would say she&#39;s guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she&#39;s a liar and say that you&#39;ve already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying &quot;don&#39;t believe everything you see&quot; because guess what, there&#39;s two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I&#39;m not going to bash her before I&#39;ve even heard her side.

She‚Äôs genuinely the sweetest human I have ever met. She agreed that what she did in the past was weird and you have to keep in mind that she was very young herself when she started Miranda Sings. She has grown so much and learned so much, as we all do. Please think about how this is affecting her and her mental health. She has said all that she feels she wanted to or could to defend herself, it‚Äôs not right to make fun of her for defending herself. She‚Äôs not just some youtuber that everyone wants off the internet. She‚Äôs a wife and mother. Think not only about her, but her family."

@shanadavis3001,"I will admit my bias because I‚Äôve been watching Colleens YouTube videos for almost 6 years now for context I never really liked Miranda Sings. I‚Äôve frankly never watched Miranda sings content unless it was for Colleen because I liked Colleen. I always loved their family‚Äôs channels and I watched Rachel, Colleen, and sometimes Chris. The whole Ballinger family that‚Äôs what I grew up with. Only recently had I started watching Colleens Vlogs less consistently Because I‚Äôve been busy with college. However, when all of this came out about Colleen a few years ago, I remember believing the person that said it and when Colleen originally addressed it everyone universally came to the understanding that she had made a mistake. The irony is all of this drama that‚Äôs coming back up is it is the same thing that people tried to cancel her with years ago. Now, by no means, am I trying to justify any of her actions, but what I‚Äôm saying is for this video specifically, I appreciated the apology. I have grown up, feeling like I‚Äôve known Colleen and known her personality, and she always turns to art when she doesn‚Äôt know how else to express herself. that‚Äôs some thing I quite liked about her because I end up doing the same thing in my personal life. The point I‚Äôm trying to make here is this apology is perfect for her in my opinion because this is an example of who Colleen is and how she deals with problems. I think it‚Äôs beautiful frankly, when an artist pours their heart into their work. I know some are saying that they would prefer for her to have been more professional in this video, but contrary to popular belief, when all of this came up years ago, she did address all of this and made a formal apology years ago. So now when people are bringing up the past again and trying to cancel her with the same old thing, I think this is a perfect way to respond and I understand if you disagree that‚Äôs all right. I could be wrong, and I could be blinded by my own nostalgia but it‚Äôs my opinion. Colleen if you happen to see this comment, just know that one of your fans has forgiven you, and still loves you.‚ù§<br><br><br>Also, just bring a little bit more perspective into this. I really don‚Äôt appreciate you guys calling her a pedophile because I am a sexual assault victim. I was raped by a 30 year old man when I was six years old he was a pedophile. Colleen making a few out of taste jokes and weird comments does not make her a pedophile. Please don‚Äôt label people with such horrific terms when they haven‚Äôt done anything to deserve it."

@kassidymcveigh6156,"Hi Colleen‚ù§Ô∏è and who ever else will read this! <br>I am so glad you made this video and I think you need it to. I have always been a silent fan. I rarely comment, but I watch every single one of your videos not exaggerating. I started watching what other people were saying about you and I began to question if it was true, but then I would see some wild things. For example, one creator made a video about you, and he had never even watched you assuming you are a family vlogger when you have said, explicitly you are not. Videos of your past of you saying not so kind things have resurfaced. What irritates me is people refuse to see your growth and the fact that you are an advocate for so many people. You are a best friend to strangers on the Internet who need you when they have nobody else, you‚Äôre a mom who reminds other moms that they are strong too, you have have mental health issues and advocate for the fans you love to accept their mental health issues as well and everybody who watches you knows they‚Äôre not alone. What people fail to realize is that your fan following is not a cult, we are people who have made mistakes too and admire your willingness to grow as a person and learn new things about life that you once didn‚Äôt know. You teach others to open their minds, just as you have learned to. Please never quit posting.

You are a comedian and make jokes. if there was a problem with a joke that was made in the past maybe people could of said something then instead of now with all the made up crap."
@mpar4313,"Omg. Just leave her alone. No one needs thousands of people saying the same negative stuff about them. No human can handle this amount of hate. Let it go and mind your own business. She has three innocent children to be a mother to, and your words are not helping. She didn&#39;t commit a crime; otherwise, she would be convicted of one, but you all act like she raped or killed young children. Im not a Colleen super fan and I&#39;m not invested in this, but I&#39;m old enough to know that all this hate will just break Colleen and her family will be greatly impacted. If you Don&#39;t like her, unfollow her and take your negativity else where."

You are going through a very difficult situation and I know from experience in my life that when something you love and something that defines who you are as a person gets ripped from you because of a mistake or rumors or hateful people it can be so overwhelming and feel so awful that you start to question who you are as a person and what is your purpose for being here.  Let me tell you in case you haven‚Äôt heard it from anyone but the people closest to you,  you are worthy of forgiveness for your mistakes!  You are worthy of love and not just from those closest to you right now.  You have touched many people and done so much good.  Don‚Äôt let other people‚Äôs agendas and need for gossip define who you are right now!  Let ‚Äúthem‚Äù cancel you!  You don‚Äôt exist to make ‚Äúthem‚Äù happy!  I feel like from being a part of your life for the past few years that the mistakes made in the past are just that, the past!  I‚Äôm still rooting for you and your family and I know I‚Äôm not the only one!"

I wonder if this pain is motivating you to be more creative, I know that&#39;s what happens to me. To me, you singing with your uke is genuine and very creative - you turned your pain into art.

@KristinReneeCreative,"Colleen I hope you‚Äôre doing ok. Just know you do have people out there who still want the best for you. You have made me laugh for years, gave me happiness as a depressed tween with no friends, helped others in their journeys to stardom, are accepting of the loser kids and gay kids and weird theater and art kids, outcasted kids, poured your heart into your work, prioritized your fans over your own health many times, you‚Äôre talented, and seemingly a wonderful mother, sister, daughter and wife. The way people have berated you, threatened you, and body shammed you over this is so vile and toxic. If the goal for this was accountability, all of those other things didn‚Äôt have to happen. This was a smear campaign. I don‚Äôt argue with there being inappropriate jokes made, I don‚Äôt want to diminish other people feelings about their experiences. This whole situation to me has been more about hurting and humiliating you and tearing apart your character with irreversible allegations that aren‚Äôt always presented in a truthful way. Calling someone‚Äôs groomer is a very serious and legally punishable thing and implies sexual abuse/relationships or other illegal activity with underage people. It‚Äôs not just talking to, joking, interacting with and being friendly with young people or every celebrity, Daily vlogger, YouTuber, Tiktoker, influencer would be considered a groomer. The YouTube community was really just beginning in 2012 and most of these YouTubers we know now had ever had experience on the platform or even much with the internet/social media altogether. MySpace was the first real ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù and it was very common for larger accounts to communicate with ‚Äòfans‚Äô of all ages in groups and messages and pen pals with younger people like an older/younger sister type relationship. That was how this generation of YouTubers grew up on the internet. Having boundaries with internet followers wasn‚Äôt something they knew they needed until they blew up enough that they had probably already crossed the boundaries most have in place today. How are you supposed to know the limitations as an internet famous person if no one had ever been internet famous before? The jokes Colleen/Miranda have made are sometimes inappropriate or even bad taste but never with ill intent never with the intention to coerce, manipulate, or groom."

If anyone has ever really watched her videos and paid attention to the kind, sweet, loving, caring personality that shines from her beautiful soul y‚Äôall would see and understand that yeah she made a mistake years ago but is not that person anymore you will see and understand that she has grown so much and only says and does with the best intentions to her knowledge.

@reinaprocee,"I&#39;m trying to understand this timeline of events...<br>Three years ago she was accused of inappropriate contact with underage fans. One in particular came out and made a video. She took accountability and apologized for her inappropriate choices and has grown and changed since then. <br>Meanwhile the person who made a video was doxed, bullied and harassed.<br>Now more corroborating evidence about her inappropriate contact has come to light and people want her to apologize again? I don&#39;t understand that. She has already apologized. If anything it&#39;s the people who bullied that one person who came out with the allegations that should apologize. <br><br>I think that maybe singing this wasn&#39;t the best move, but she is a human and people are emotional and flawed and that&#39;s kinda ok. I don&#39;t know what glowing saint person you want to see on here, but I always felt like she was honest about her missteps and mistakes and took strides to learn from them.<br><br>I&#39;m 40 and it would kill me if people still judged me based on who I was 15 years ago.

She&#39;s come so far from where she started, she helps more then she&#39;s &quot;hurt&quot; since then. Like she said people say things and everyone feels like they want to be part of something by hating her. Your not just hurting her but the family she&#39;s grown and the loved ones that have to see her in distress. It&#39;s really sad, and I&#39;m not trying to validate anything that she has done. But I&#39;m sure u guys have forgiven friends and family that&#39;s done more then just text people trying to be funny in an inappropriate way.

@AmberC17,"Guess what everyone. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how or what she said. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if she apologized the way you or anyone else wanted. Shes absolutely correct. No one is going to care what she has to say. They wont believe it anyway. So why not do it however she damn well pleases"
@summererofeyeff5370,"Look, I understand that there have been more than small mistakes made in the past and that Colleen should take a little more accountability for that. However, as she said, people make mistakes at the end of the day, and I don&#39;t think it is on the public to constantly scrutinise her about it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t watch. <br><br>Her actions with fans in the past went over the line; however, that doesn&#39;t mean that she is a terrible mother; I have watched her vlogs since she got pregnant with the twins and didn&#39;t have any doubt about her love and devotion for them. Sure, they are displayed in videos, but what person online doesn&#39;t do that? It&#39;s not only her, and it&#39;s something to look back at for memories.<br><br>Again I say if you dislike it, don&#39;t watch it. I will never understand how people think that it is ok to harass others. She is well aware of her mistakes and leaving harassing comments won&#39;t change that."

Since I was watching you in the past and watched these videos or heard these things you&#39;re being accused from in the moment they happened I feel I am justified to say that I don&#39;t believe you did anything wrong. Humor was a lot different back then and you did what you did to make people laugh back then but I feel you understand how things were wrong and you&#39;re not that person anymore. I have missed you a lot. I think you are an amazing person and I will continue to watch and feel like I am your friend.

Please do not trust her with any type of para social relationship. Miranda has showed the type of person that she actually is she talks badly about the people that care most about her. Frankly there‚Äôs not even a real reason for it if you are a fan of hers please just take into consideration.that could‚Äôve been you. You could‚Äôve been the one talking to the person that you have looked up to for years. Just to later be thrown away and to really know how she actually felt. Leaving Miranda behind now will just be character growth.

When I was a teenager my dad told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do good things that look bad‚Äù because regardless of my thoughts or intentions going into things, what will be addressed is what was done. That learning to align my intentions with proper actions is a way to create boundaries of respect for myself and for the people I interact with. I can‚Äôt imagine the magnitude of learning lessons publicly online where every mistake can be brought up for all of time. I myself am far from perfect and when my soul is heavy with my own shortcomings I often turn to the quote ‚ÄúI hope you live a life you‚Äôre proud of. And if you are not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again‚Äù. I don‚Äôt wish you pain but in the face of this storm, if you don‚Äôt survive the train wreck, I do hope you find a new life on the other side.

She has changed certain things because of the fact that yes she‚Äôs learned from them and now she‚Äôs saying I took up accountability and am taking accountability for my past mistakes, so why do you have to try to ruin my reputation in order to have your fun. I can really tell who has  been a fan for while, by seeing who actually thinks she‚Äôs a bad person all of a sudden I know who isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been watching Colleen not Miranda for like 10 years and I can confidently say that she is not a bad person and I might not know her personally, but her entire career has been based on making people laugh.

But as soon as I learned more about this stuff happening behind the scenes, no part of me could ignore it (remember that whole mom thing?). This video was highly disappointing. We get that people are humans and are bound to make mistakes. Even your young viewers know that. But to play the victim and not truly take accountability was almost as bad as the mistakes you made. I kinda feel like you <b>thought</b> you were taking accountability in this video but you weren‚Äôt. And to add a ukulele in was just poor taste. It would‚Äôve just been better for you to not say anything at all. These kids feel victimized and rightfully so‚Ä¶whether you believe that yourself or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter. You cannot take responsibility for mistakes while also playing the victim. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. I really feel for the kids going through this. I hope one day it‚Äôll finally click for you.

I love it, stand up for what you believe in Colleen. We don&#39;t have any right to meddle in your life, and the way these kids are bringing stuff to the public using cancel culture is not the right way of doing things and nothing good comes out of it.

I think it‚Äôs better for you to put up your ukulele and stop singing and actually make a video that is genuine and give an explanation for everything, even if it makes you look bad in the past it shows that you‚Äôre taking accountability and are willing to change.

People were really hurt, Colleen. I‚Äôm writing this as a previous fan, and person who always looks to kindness and positivity. I think most people know that Miranda is PG-13, but still most of the fans of Miranda are children so it‚Äôs not fair to them to be put in situations they don‚Äôt understand but adults do. I hope you read this specific comment from a place of caring and love, because as a previous fan I do care about you as a human being.

Recently I have met someone at work who has watched your videos since the beginning like me and we have created a friendship and its because we bonded over you. You put out so much positivity, creativity, and realness to the world and I hope you can continue to do that. We both sat together and watched this and felt your pain through the video and I just want to say I have NEVER commented on ANY of your videos nor any other youtube video lol but I know how much they help so I thought I&#39;d do it even if you don&#39;t see this.

Through your vlogs you can see that in essence you‚Äôre a real human, an empathetic soul, who unfortunately is capable of the human mistake of caring too much what other people think and wanting people to like you. Find me one person who does not crave approval in one way or another, you are not perfect, find me one person who is. You are good, and that is good enough!"

@ivyleafwinters,"This is really disappointing. I have been a fan since around 2014-2015, and this video is not it. Fine, some of what is being said could be embellished or twisted to make accusations more dramatic, but never in this video did you call out the things that are untrue or dramatized. Instead, you made a song seemingly mocking the people who have made serious accusations against you. You did not give any evidence of things being taken out of context or lied about so how are we supposed to believe that the accusations are untrue when there are screenshots out there that are pretty shocking. Also, girl, this is not taking accountability. Taking accountability would be calling out specifically what you did wrong and apologizing to those parties and definitely not in song. I thought your channel was a safe space on YouTube but now I don&#39;t believe it is."

I&#39;m not sure if you are a believer in God and I don&#39;t mean to make this religious, but my intention is to give you strength here. God is the only one to judge you in life and while the voices of media and those close to you are loudly pointing their fingers at you. Please remember something it&#39;s all forgivable. You aren&#39;t a bad person or a horrific person because of your mistake. Just learn from them. I think you&#39;re a beautiful and talented human. An amazing mother who has 3 very lucky babies. You are human and as my sister in Christ I love you and I have pain seeing the world pull you to pieces. Stay strong, find strength in prayer. I promise you it helps. Keep family close and just stay away from media. I&#39;m sure the crows we&#39;ll find someone else to attack soon enough. Keep your head up, shine bright, and remember there is nothing that isn&#39;t forgivable in the eyes of God as long as you seek that forgiveness and learn. Sending you love and honestly a really big hug because I&#39;m sure you need one. ‚ù§"

I understand why you said it in a song. I have missed seeing your face. Take your time and heal. Come back when your ready. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
@tinapelletier4788,"Colleen, <br><br>I have been watching you for years. I have enjoyed you, your family, and truly feel like I&#39;m a part of your life. When the accusations came out, I was utterly confused. None of it made sense. It didn&#39;t fit the Colleen that I know and it didn&#39;t seem to add up in my mind as the accusations seemed to be far fetched. Whether there can be some truth to any of them, is none of our business. That said, there are two sides to every story and even then, there&#39;s still more story. <br><br>You are an incredible inspiration to others. Your kindness, your realness, your laughter, your humor, your hair - every little bit about you makes you REAL. So many people on the internet try to be someone they are not and you aren&#39;t like that. These people who are attacking your character and reputation, don&#39;t know the real you. It can be argued that none of us really do, but I believe that a person&#39;s true motives can be discerned early on and you don&#39;t deserve to be silenced, to wither away, to feel this pain and anguish, or to have this level of total disgust and disdain thrown your way. <br><br>Keep pushing through, love. Do not lose your spark, your joy, your creativity, your realness. Don&#39;t let others&#39; negativity cloud your sun. <br><br>I don&#39;t comment much, but know you have support in your corner - even if it doesn&#39;t seem like you do at times. ‚ù§"

People need to remember that she is a human and that the internet thrives off rumours and dragging other people down. Why don‚Äôt we focus on people who have done genuine wrong, instead of people who made mistakes years ago and continues to work and improve on these mistakes."

Even if it was an unfortunate mistake that seemed to hurt people, if you choose to lean and grow and change the way you behave, in my personal opinion that‚Äôs enough to show you actually are remorseful of your behaviour and there is tons of room for forgiveness. Anyway just wanted to sound off for the people who didn‚Äôt jump on the train cuz they see a genuine caring woman in you and we‚Äôre standing with you the whole time üëç"
