@Doseplays1,"For those wondering what the japanese on the stores say from left to right:<br><br>らめん - Ramen, more commonly written as らーめん or ラーメン<br><br>阮清國 (small brown sign next to ramen shop, probably the store name itself) - &quot;the pure country&quot;, 阮 denoting place name, 清 kanji meaning pure / alternative spelling of 明 (bright), 國 archaic spelling of 国 country (fitting for kyoto)<br><br>南　南海藝術 スタジオ 日本 - Southern ocean art studio japan, 南 (the one in the circle) south, 南海 southern ocean, 藝術 archaic spelling of 芸術 arts / the arts, スタジオ studio, 日本 Japan<br><br>電話 - phone (shortened from 電話番号 phone number). Fun fact, kyoto&#39;s area code is actually 075 not 085. The number on the sign would be from either Shimane or Tottori province.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve only passed the N5 so these might not be completely correct."
