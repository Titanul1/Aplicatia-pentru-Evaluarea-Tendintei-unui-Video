Comment: I&#39;m not sure if someone has commented about this before, but this whole series pronounces the theme like that in the anime called &#39;Ergo Proxy.&#39; From the use of grayscale color tones, as well as the division of the societal hierarchies and surprise factors (i.e. Monsters).<br><br>It is magnificently drawn out in my opinion, from art styles, environment settings, to storytelling.

Comment: I think the worst part of being ugly is you hurt others by your existence. You can have them look at you, or you can use politics to silence them and force acceptance, either way they get hurt. You are a walking visual hazard. Through no fault of your own.

Comment: What I find interesting is that they don‚Äôt put them there because they‚Äôre different. They put them there because they‚Äôre less efficient/productive. To maintain the society that they have in a world that surrounds them with poisonous gas they need to get rid of disabled, elderly, those who aren‚Äôt productive (unemployed), and those who can‚Äôt reproduce (gays, divorced, and sterile won‚Äôt/no adoption or abandonment). They don‚Äôt just leave them around because they use them as fuel to keep the giant lady alive, in turn continuing to allow all of humanity to survive (prevents toxic air from getting to their little bubble). I find it interesting that this isn‚Äôt a world made of malice or greed, but of inconvenient circumstances and strategic planning to preserve a human society/ecosystem.<br>If you look at both this video and Model Citizen, as well as one of the videos where you get to see the mayor, you can tell it‚Äôs not some lunatic trying to impress his opinions on what people should be like, but trying to maintain what‚Äôs left of a species. Like notice how race/color isn‚Äôt a thing that gets them in the pit (of course there may just not be variations of race, but still). They want the straight couples to reproduce and they want them to be trauma-less (or enough to not impede on their ability to function in society- as seen in the friendly shadow video), and overall able to function (disabled and unemployable will be less efficient)<br><br>In our society we have the luxury to allow people who are ‚Äúless efficient‚Äù at maintaining a population‚Äôs numbers to thrive and live their lives. However in this society there just isn‚Äôt that opportunity.

Comment: After reviewing all the comments, I did not find any clear explanation about the video. In my opinion, the video is not about perfection or imperfection but rather about fulfilling one&#39;s duties and responsibilities. The &quot;Pretty&quot; characters in the video are those who take responsibility for their actions, such as the parents and neighbors who wore masks and the masks carried nothing written on them. The children were not wearing masks because they were playing and having fun, without a sense of responsibility. The robot told them that they would become &quot;Pretty&quot; like their parents one day, indicating that responsibility is key to becoming &quot;Pretty.&quot;<br><br> On the other hand, the &quot;Ugly&quot; characters in the well are those who failed to fulfill their duties and responsibilities and their masks carried several names on them. The video suggests that all individuals who neglect their responsibilities and duties in society are &quot;Ugliest&quot; and will be left behind. For example, the blind, the elderly, the divorced, and those who do not contribute to society are all &quot;Ugliest.&quot; However, the video also implies that killing the &quot;Ugliest&quot; is not the solution because it will lead to the robots taking over the society. Instead, the video emphasizes that everyone should work together to fulfill their responsibilities and duties to build a better society for all.<br><br>Please correct me if I was wrong in explaining this masterpiece.

Comment: This vision of a future in which all respectable citizens were not only expected to wear masks, but furthermore induced to expect the same of all other respectable citizens, expressing a much more far-reaching and deep-rooted need to comply and conform one&#39;s behaviour and opinions to the announcements issuing from governments and authorities assuring us of their expertise and commitment to public health and well-being, was uncannily prescient.  The only thing I missed here was any reference to an epidemic of the unva.., sorry: uglies.

Colocando tipo uma superioridade e diminuindo aqueles que n√£o fazem parte de um determinado padr√£o de esteriotipo, condi√ß√µes sociais, apar√™ncia, etc. Ou seja, isso faz com que tenha uma divis√£o ,preconceitos e at√© discrimina√ß√£o com os menos favorecidos.

Comment: I think the perspective is wrong. It&#39;s not that people who are unusual are taken away or rejected, it&#39;s that they often don&#39;t try to fix themselves. They don&#39;t try to become a better person. They just wallow in their grief or misery. And THAT&#39;s when they get rejected by people. <br><br>Think about it like this: let&#39;s say you have a depressed friend. He is constantly looking for ways to fulfill himself and fill the void. This friend can be saved. But if he was instead, ignoring your efforts to help, forgoing professional help, etc... This friend has doomed himself. If he sits there and victimizes himself instead of looking for a way out, why should society help him if he doesn&#39;t even want to help himself? This logic can be applied to most fat, most who are about to divorce, etc. There are quite often solutions to help these people, yet they don&#39;t help themselves. <br><br>Something like being crippled, deaf, blind, already divorced, etc... Society actually helps these people tremendously. If you see a man with sunglasses and a long stick in front of him, you move out of the way and make a grunt or scuff your feet. The government gives these people money to live, and tax breaks of all kinds. Nearly one judges you for something that&#39;s out of your control. <br><br>It&#39;s those who simply sit and wallow in their suffering and play the victim card for everything that are rejected. <br><br><br>Also, I found it funny that &quot;gay&quot; was in there, just saying.

Comment: So I&#39;m getting alot of the hidden messages/innuendo&#39;s... but I can&#39;t really understand why the &quot;pretty&quot; people are to wear the mask as well? If classification is so prominent in the demonbots agenda/propaganda why the mask.... Is it just to add an extra layer of control as the mask gives the &quot;pretty&quot; people an ILLUSION of not being &quot;special&quot; so they don&#39;t become aware of their individuality and start thinking for themselves or is it deeper than that?

Comment: I think that the message of this is, in our day of age if you hide who you really are and try to fit in with society, you are considered &quot;pretty&quot;. If you don&#39;t hide who you really are and your imperfections, you are considered &quot;ugly&quot;, and then you got tossed into a pit of hate, and are not considered equal. And I think that really shows what our society has come to. Kids in schools being bullied because their &quot;different&quot;. People having hate piled on them because they don&#39;t do this or aren&#39;t that. It really shows how horrible humanity is.

Comment: I‚Äôm surprised <br>They have ‚ÄúDivorced‚Äù, that implies that there is a law for the right to get divorced, only to get murked by the city.<br>I would imagine that there is no way a married couple could get divorced, because there is no discussion or law for it. And this couple broke things up on their own, storming out of each other‚Äôs lives only to either:<br>Be found out<br>Or<br>They handed themselves in<br><br>Same with being gay<br>There definitely won‚Äôt be any LGBTQ+ rep on TV or anywhere else, cause robots don‚Äôt know what love is and just want people to produce offspring.<br>I imagine that person either found no love in the straight relationship he was forced into and handed himself in<br>Or<br>He had a crush on a guy and thought he was defective and again, handed himself in.<br><br>I don‚Äôt imagine that he would know what ‚ÄúGay‚Äù even meant, cause there would be no mention of it in Autodale‚Äôs society. And Autodale‚Äôs definitely too dangerous to have a gay relationship and will found out by handimen. <br><br>Besides the brainwashing, for both divorced and gay, would have themselves see themselves as ‚Äúugly‚Äù anyway.

Comment: So my take on this short film, is that the robots in the film took control over the world, and they studied us human, and saw us treating, ugly, gay, divorced, handicapped, etc people differently(in other words as a society we kind of downgrade this people).<br>And these robots basically take our behavior to the extreme, and kill everyone who has imperfections <br>To make the perfect people like this robots who are perfect

Comment: The mask that the parents wear must have a deep meaning. It‚Äôs that the new generation, once grown will follow the same routine as their parents. I see that it is highly judgmental too. It‚Äôs like they must be perfect through the eyes of the robot or else they‚Äôll be killed. A very Harsh message but the video carries a deep deep message about how judgmental society can be to those different from us‚Ä¶ or so I view it that way.

Comment: I think this episode is early in the timeline because of the individual labels on the &quot;uglies&quot;. Her they&#39;re individually labeled for what trait made them &quot;ugly&quot;. This was likely gotten rid of later down the timeline because it took up too much brainpower printing all the different types of tags and keeping track of which is which didn&#39;t really matter anyway because they&#39;re *all going to the same place&quot;.

Author: Jenny G.
Comment: I think the &quot;Pretty&quot; vs &quot;Ugly&quot; people ultimately has to do with whatever is considered &quot;accepted&quot; by the Mainstream Media and other types of propaganda.<br><br>Not a fan of Masks and Social Distancing?<br>- Ugly! <br><br>Not a fan of the Vaccines? <br>- Ugly! <br><br>Not a fan of celebrating Pride Month? <br>- Ugly! <br><br>Support Heterosexual couples and want children?*<br>- Ugly!<br><br>Want to support 2nd Amendment, US Constitution, and other Conservative Values?<br>  - Ugly! <br><br>Don&#39;t support Global Climate Change or UN?<br>   - Ugly!!! <br><br>&amp; On, and On!! üòè<br><br><i>_____</i><br>* I wanted to add a note here about Heterosexual vs Homosexual couples.<br>First, I have an Uncle on my Dad&#39;s side of the Family, who&#39;s come out and identifies as a member of the LGBTQ+ Community. I love him as my Uncle and he&#39;s an amazing, talented Man.<br><br> Secondly, while I believe that consenting Adults can choose to be Gay or Straight, what I don&#39;t like is pressuring society to &quot;teach&quot; kids how to be homosexual.  Or rather promoting the idea that children shouldn&#39;t have a basic concept of their own biology. <br><br>I&#39;m afraid children today might be choosing to transition their bodies surgically before they fully understand the consequences of their actions because it seems to be the popular trend right now. That&#39;s not to say that helping youth become aware of things that they&#39;re noticing about themselves, but to make sure they differentiate between what they really are struggling with and what they Think they&#39;re supposed to be like even when they wouldn&#39;t normally choose to do so.<br><br> It wouldn&#39;t be fair for the LGBTQ+ Community to have youth pretending and potentially mocking something that people who really Do identify as an LGBTQ+ person and unintentionally lying to this individual and themselves (the child).<br><br>My Mom recently reminded me of one of my other uncles (her brother) who at the time was hearing his peers tell him that their own parents were getting a divorce. While this could certainly be the case for whomever first shared this with their classmates, my Grandparents were certainly fine with their own marriage. <br>When my Uncle told his teacher, she got concerned about it and called my Grandma. She said that &quot;No! My Husband and I aren&#39;t getting a divorce.&quot;<br>  The relieved teacher told her about the situation and later after my Grandma explained it to my Uncle, he later apologized to his teacher and covering his mistake up, he said that he was &quot;just kidding&quot;.

Comment: But what if we replace those tags for &quot;undesired&quot;, &quot;result of incest&quot;, &quot;unplanned&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;poor&quot;, or &quot;deformed&quot;; and what if, instead of grown-ups, they are kids, babies, or embryos?<br>Yes, you guessed it, that&#39;s the eugenic ideal behind abortions. And who does promote all this pro-human-life-discarding? <br><b>The left.</b> <br><br>Do you seriously think those who promote the genocide of humankind would care for others? Oh, boy, they want you to depend on the government, to miserably ask for social assistance, to be vulnerable and submissive to their power. They want you to have no private money, private house, or private education; they want to be the only providers of everything.<br><br>On the contrary, the right defends the life of all innocent people. We respect everyone as long as they don&#39;t force us to see the world exclusively their way. Along with that, we look for poverty reduction through business incentives and entrepreneurial benefits. We seek financial freedom, not tax chaining.

Comment: this is just an exaggerated reflection of the way our world already is. They start deciding your worth from the moment you enter school. And if you don&#39;t fit certain expectations you spend the rest of your life working against the flow of the system or just ending up homeless or in poverty. Luckily they haven&#39;t started dropping us into mass graves yet.

Comment: From what I see here, is that people who are different from the social norm (very much like our society but greatly exaggerated.) is shunned for being different as soon as they reach adulthood. And as the robots analogy suggests, the citizens are all gears turning, keeping Autodale running. And those who are different are seen as misshapen, broken, disfigured, gears that don‚Äôt fit in the machines, so they are disposed of as they no longer have usefulness. When children grow up, or are forged into new gears to fit into the place of old, rusted, and dull gears. (old gears referrer to their parents) Society is all a machine, constantly needing new parts for repairs as it‚Äôs large and active systems require such. And nobody wants a broken machine, do they‚Ä¶ <br><br><br>Edit : I did not see ‚Äúthe making of being pretty‚Äù when I made this. I was merely connecting dots.

Comment: Honestly, I think this is my first time learning what Dystopian genre was. When I was younger, I was recommended these Dystopian-based videos, but I never 100% understood them. As I grew older, I understand what the story is and what the citizens of Autodale are dealing with. However, I want to say thank you David for creating this Dystopian-based story (I slowly but surely started to love and understand it) and your hard work put to this. In my perspective, Dystopian is a very interesting kind of genre not all talk of.<br>Updated: 7/20/23 :)

I could feel it but not understand it. Now so much time later so late at night I have gone down the rabbit hole and now I have come to it.

Every new experience is happy.  They are growing and learning. Adults have experienced, and know what to expect.  So the A.I. like smiling faces.  IE the masks.   It is an algorithm based on advertisement.

Comment: I don&#39;t know exactly why people are boys/or girls who are not satisfied with their nature, whether they are girls or boys, and turn into gays. This indicates their lack of self-confidence, lack of self-love and their wrong influence: if you created a boy, then be creative in being a wonderful and respectable boy, the most important thing is, and if you created a girl  So pretend that you are a wonderful girl, but you are respectful, and this is not related to my personal opinion. If you created a boy, then you are wonderful and you are a boy, and you do not need to be a girl to be wonderful, and if you created a girl, you are wonderful and you are a girl. You do not have to be a boy. Accept yourselves as you were created, and strive to be better as you are.  you

Comment: In reality the robot is  saying that if they don&#39;t want to be a  perfect work machine or arent able to anymore they are useless and therefore &quot;ugly&quot; and killed. And whats scary is that the &quot;model citicens&quot; dont even realize that anything is wrong. A perfect distopia that makes it seem like a utopia for the one&#39;s in it. This may be an exaggeration but describes human life perfectly. When you are small you get to play and do fun stuff to once become useful, parents care. Then you are the work machine being usful for society. But once you have reached an age where you arent useful anymore people slowly care less and less...

Do believe me when I say that I am deeply sorry, but you have lost an arm and your legs are now broken; there is no hope you could ever return to your former degree of production required by our standards, You understand why we must do this. Though rest assured, your soon-to-be widowed wife and soon-to-be orphaned son won&#39;t have to grieve over your loss for long, that I can promise&quot;

Comment: Quite contradicting actually. Let&#39;s flip this around. Does programming every single person to accept everyone and everything is pretty work?<br>How long until the society starts out-casting those &quot;negative&quot; people into the pit? Trading human rights on free wills/opinions for social justice/standard. <br>Balance is the key. The world is not just black and white. That&#39;s what makes it interesting.<br><br>Quoting someone on the internet: &quot;When someone challenges or questions a fact or opinion I have stated, it allows me to have a different perspective on the subject.&quot;<br><br>Ask yourself this: &quot;do you criticize your own thoughts on thinking someone&#39;s fat or ugly?&quot;  &quot;is that okay for someone to be uncomfortable around gay people?&quot; &quot;are your emotions effect hugely by others disagreement and why is that?&quot;

You&#39;re divorced? Pit. You&#39;re disfigured? Pit. You&#39;re retarded? Pit. Deaf? Mute? Pit. You&#39;re fat? Pit. You&#39;re depressed? Pit. Crippled? Old? Sterile? Blind? Unemployed? Sick? Gay? Pit. Honestly this scared me more than it should have.

Comment: This is the most beautiful short film I‚Äôve ever seen<br>In our society we have the concept that what is ‚Äúunnormal‚Äù is ‚Äúunknown‚Äù is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, is bad and it need to be cancelled. The fun thing is that the children don‚Äôt wear a mask like the adults because they‚Äôre still pure and innocent and they not feel the rule of hide themselves and be like everyone, be ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. And governament try to wash their brain and teach them to be racist, omophobic and other things I don‚Äôt know how to say in english (im italian). Like the Nazism.

Comment: Honestly this hits me hard because well, I‚Äôm part of the ‚Äúugly‚Äù society, I feel like everyone judges me when they see me and I don‚Äôt fit in because I‚Äôm a bit chubby. Also don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúprettiest‚Äù face. And when I seek for help because I can‚Äôt get better on my own as I‚Äôve tried before all I see is this unhumane Standard level of so called beauty, basically for years now I‚Äôve been living stressed and worried almost all the time I‚Äôm in public because of how many people judge others, though it‚Äôs been getting better as I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm pretty in my own ways, and who ever think they aren‚Äôt well. You are pretty in your own ways as well. But DAMN, this video is true about today‚Äôs society

Comment: It confuses me that we didn&#39;t see any babies or children in the pits. Why do you think that is? Are all children with known defects aborted, leaving only some individuals who get to adulthood before revealing an imperfection? My guess with the &quot;uglies&quot; that said &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;disfigured&quot; was that they were recntly made that way; otherwise they would have died long ago. Or could it be that the ones who run Autodale know how powerful parental love is, and so they wait until children are &quot;out of the nest&quot; to dispose of them quietly, rather than ripping them away from their parents and causing a scene?

Comment: Let‚Äôs say that at some point in the future, the revolution does come. Let‚Äôs say that the children actually fight back against the Handymen and eventually kill the Matriarch. If that ever ended up happening, the adults would lose all hope and start killing themselves.<br>If the adults of Autodale ever lost their authoritarian system, they would also lose all sense of purpose and safety. Basically they would go from lining up to fall in the pit, to lining up to jump of a cliff. The absolute end result would be a community of orphaned children forced to survive in the untamed wilderness with no adult support.

So they kill people for being blind, divorced, gay and &#39;fat&#39; but they don&#39;t kill off the actual bad people? Sounds pretty much like a republican state.

If we keep on making technology as our gods , time will come like it&#39;s actually happening now we gonna be the slaves of our own inventions and it&#39;s all our faults. Damm humanüòî

Comment: I‚Äôm guessing this is set in the not-so-far future, where robots are programmed by their masters at first but then they develop and have feelings in some way. After this, they take over and brainwash the citizens that you have to be pretty and anybody else that isn‚Äôt, ends up in a literal pit. It‚Äôs sickening how they‚Äôre just chucked into the pit and the fact they know that one day, they will become old and therefore, ‚Äònot pretty‚Äô.

Comment: this video is definitely about a communist regime. as a person that is from a post communist country this is how my parents said that living in the 80s was like. Everyone was forced to have a job, or they would go to prison. Nobody was allowed to say negative things about the government. Telephone calls were leaked to the government so that they could listen to you. If you were caught saying negative stuff about the government, you were jailed. And also ho homosexuality, no churches, no God, no faith. Not even access to western society. The television only worked 2 hours a day and was full off propaganda. The music was only ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù propaganda made by the communist army.

Comment: This story from my perspective shows that &quot;they&quot; values good over bad. The bad one, being thrown away while the good one or the normal one is their priority. &quot;They&quot; are the community, the socials people. Judgemental Society. Why are the deaf, blind, gay or ugly is dead from this story? mostly because of the discriminates. Ignored and mocked by the society. From our early age, we often learnt that many fairytales would end in a good way. World we&#39;ve been told is always surrounded with good things. That is &quot;their&quot; goals. Still, about the mask i quite unsure. Maybe it looks happy outside but rotten inside? Pretending? Idk, just my opinion tho.

Comment: Here&#39;s my theory:<br><br>Towards the end, the people that were thrown into the holes had offensive labels such as r*t*rd, fat, blind, deaf, disfigure, etc. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Vh_w_Qb1A&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a>)<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that illustrates how society treats people that fall into certain groups, such as specific sexual orientation, body types, physical appearance, etc. <br><br>The people that are still alive are labeled as &quot;pretty.&quot; They&#39;re labeled that way because they &quot;fit&quot; in society&#39;s standards, rather than those who are killed and thrown into the holes.

Comment: Wouldn&#39;t they be killing a pretty big percent population every day... like if they start out with 1000        &quot; perfect&quot; people 500 male and 500 female and they all have one kid then that would cut the population down to 500 by the next generation and out of that generation let&#39;s say that...20 of them are  not perfect. That would leave 480 people to breed and that&#39;s assuming that there is one boy for every girl. And yes people can have twins,triplets and so on but assuming that every women can only get pregnant once what are the odds that there will be 1 boy for every girl...and what are the odds that they will be perfect...And how many kids would die before reaching adulthood....As much as I love the artwork and concept it seems like the population would shirk pretty quickly.

Well, we can all see the literal writing telling us, feels kind of insulting to the intelligence of the viewer?<br>You had a good metaphor going, and then you explained it. And like a joke, that&#39;s never good unless you&#39;re dealing with Young children. And the mass graves suggests you&#39;re not.

Comment: They were not talking about people&#39;s physical appearance (but I did saw &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;face disorder-&quot;) they were saying that everyone that isn&#39;t a stereotypical person (like, a woman who marries, has a family, cleans the house, cooks or a man who works a lot, has a family and etc..) is unacceptable, but tbh, we all find stereotypical people boring, like, what is the point of living if you already know all that&#39;s gonna happen in your life?? - the world would be really boring and.. Dead?

Comment: Damn this hits so much harder after watching ‚ÄúImmortal Machine‚Äù
-----------------
Author: Claudia G.
Comment: [Spoilers for Immortal Machine]<br><br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking about this film and its metaphorical messages in light of the city&#39;s background story. Initially it seems like it&#39;s not a film about our society&#39;s bigotry anymore, because here it&#39;s all a ploy to collect sacrifices. However, I think it can still be connected.<br>When the Mayor first build the town and ran the &#39;unethical experiments&#39; to keep the goddess alive, he must have met resistance from the other human survivors. So I believe he exploited their prejudices to make them stand by while he killed people. He may have advocated for eugenics to convince them to get rid of the &quot;uglies&quot;. I think it&#39;s fairly realistic that in a post-apocalypse where the future of humanity seems doomed, people could be easily convinced of such a foul ideology.

Set in a dystopian era, it defines a world where humans are surgery-ied/transformed into &quot;pretties&quot; (similar to here), until the protogonist decides not to get the surgery and discovers the dark truth about the society and rebel against it. It was a cool series üòä‚úåÔ∏è

Comment: There was no &quot;disability&quot; or &quot;abnormality&quot; before the medical profession took shape in the late 1700s or so. These terms weren&#39;t used in public to describe others. People who were blind, deaf, disfigured or crippled were seen simply as variations of humanity, much like a littler of kittens that includes different colors. Just as all the kittens are just cats, so the deaf, blind, etc. are just people.<br>Not until the medical profession began categorizing people did the government follow suit, arbitrarily setting  age limits for seniority, retirement, and general ability (as with driving).<br>Medicine and government will tell you when you&#39;re too sick or old to earn a wage, but you&#39;re never too much of either to be expected to pay bills or taxes. Funny, that.

Comment: Timeline: This is when Autodale was first founded. Surviving humans came together and built the town on the ruins of another. Now that the town is established and the next generation has been born healthy and whole, all undesirable elements are being eliminated. The physically and mentally infirmed, those unable or unwilling to reproduce, those with genetic traits like a tendency for obesity, and that is just what is shown. This is being enforced by the creation and activation of an army of Handymen. Later, we discover that other towns like Autodale were founded in a similar manner, likely at the same time as Autodale, but have since failed. I think that Autodale has remained successful because of the implementation of HIVE later in the video series.

Comment: Friendly reminder, some people seem to think these are the views of the creator himself, but it is all just the film.

Comment: yes, they use plastic pretty as a way of denying us things. It backfires with eating disorders, pretty girl shaming and accepting unhealthy weights, big and thin. If you were so good, you would be a size 1 with big blue eyes and blonde hair, a bit of a tan, and a good singing voice, but you&#39;re not, so your prince charming will never want you, you aren&#39;t good enough, you don&#39;t deserve things, etc.  Almost all youths are attractive, so tell the plastic clones to go away, and tell the old hag she has expired, and it&#39;s time for her to knit like a grandma.  Big girls don&#39;t cry.  You really have to try to be ugly at certain ages. And you should be healthy and take care of yourself.

Comment: Mass murder is far worse when done by machenes than by humans. Humans are random, impulsive, make mistakes, have dreams, fethises, things they enjoy, things they dislike and all these fetures can and usually will change. Even the most evil person might show mercy if only for the purpose of seeing what will happen. <br><br>A machene never does this. They are to logical and un-changing. They don&#39;t get bored, they don&#39;t change at random and they are not curious. A robot dosen&#39;t even need to be convinced to do horrible things. You just need to tell  them to do it.

Comment: This animation is like a <a href="http://horror.it/">horror.It</a> shows a program at the TV, no uglies just pretty. And they don&#39;t even know what happens to the uglies.The uglies in this movie are helpless people.Those who need help or took a stand for thier future.Or those who look old and nobody want to take care of the.Those who are blind and deaf need help.Also those who are gay or divorced.They are all helpless people and they need help.THEY ARE NOT UGLIES.

Comment: Just realized after watching this I watched an anime called No. 6 and this series has kinda the same theme a No. 6 (No saying they stole the plot of No.6 but the wall, the &quot;Freaks&quot; on the outside, A lot of tech, large thing in the middle of the city, city run by something/ someone, kinda in that ball park) BUT!!! No. 6 plot is more horror and has gay kissing and Parastitce Wasps, and they distroyed the wall of No. 6 but Dead Sound he has no intent of having the people rise up against the robots. And No. 6 was made in like 2011, also idk if the creator is even into anime.

Author: hxnx
Comment: I think people are misunderstanding a bit- the robots don&#39;t care about how someone <i>actually</i> looks. the citizens are getting called &quot;ugly&quot; and getting killed because Autodale (and the robots) think people who are crippled, retarded, gay, disfigured, deaf, blind, etc. should not be part of a &quot;perfect&quot; society; i.e. a utopia, and therefore need to be killed to maintain &quot;this perfect cycle&quot;. they call them &quot;ugly&quot; so that the &quot;next model citizens&quot; aka the children will get the impression to &quot;never be ugly&quot;, and &quot;always be pretty&quot;. <br><br><br>idk if all that made sense but that&#39;s my take on it xD

Comment: Question about autodail if somebody gets ill or is born with deficiency‚Äôs or gets sick basically anything to do with health that‚Äôs different to others would they be deemed ugly in the eyes of autodail and would their mother and father be a ugly for giving birth to a sick child (I‚Äôm saying sick to shortern it if you are born with mental disorder you are not sick ) have they failed I have so many questions like job wise what do they do for jobs are the robots docters is there schools? Are there jobs like lawyers or elections what if somebody murders another ? Would there be a court ü§î where did the handy men come from did hive make them <br>If hive knew something was wrong with autodail why make a bigger hive what dose she benifite form it how to u become hive how do their bodies maintain themselves why was is there malls for clothes so handy men do all the other jobs where do the cars come from is autodail the only city left or is it just unkwooooooon what dose it mean to be considered perfect? What do they do with the ‚Äòuglies‚Äô bodies I have so many questions but I‚Äôm tired of typing sorry if there is any spelling mistakes<br><br>(Edit) I just realised handy men where there before hive üòì<br><br>Edit so I rewatched auto dail And half my Questions we‚Äôre awnsered but what if but one of the questions about sick People still Stan would their parents become ‚Äòuglies‚Äô too

Comment: This is so fucked up. I mean seriously, in their world, if you are aren&#39;t stereotypically beautiful, you get thrown into a pit to die. I kinda wonder what would happen if a big group of people started a revolution against the robots though. If the group was big enough, would they be able to take them down? but at the same time I feel like there&#39;s no way that would happen because people would be too afraid to get thrown into the pit.

Comment: I watched the whole series and heres my theory. I think that this is a post apocalyptic world where autodale is the only surviving human city and killing people who are &quot;ugly&quot; is a form of artificial natural selection to keep the &quot;good genes&quot; and to control the size of the population so the resources they have doesnt run out

Comment: Even if I&#39;m not gay or a disabled person. If i&#39;m just someone who isn&#39;t happy then, i&#39;m classified as &#39;&#39; depressed &#39;&#39; and  I&#39;m a waste? Then, I don&#39;t have the right to be considered &#39;&#39; pretty &#39;&#39; aswell?? So that means i&#39;m even forced to be &#39;&#39; happy &#39;&#39; in order to be valuable for society? So that means I can&#39;t even feel how I want to if Mr. Society disagrees?

Comment: Fortunately things don&#39;t go like this, but society has a lot of judgments and sticks us labels before we even start dreaming...<br>There is still too little tolerance and discrimination, every person has an important role and it is the person who must define it, not society, and I hope that society will be more grateful to the people who allowed it to exist.

I apologize for my spelling, I have to write all this through a translator. keep it up, it&#39;s great!

Comment: Y&#39;know what would have made this even creepier and more disturbing? If POC were in the pits for being POC. Not tryin to say nothing political  (We&#39;ve got more than enough of that everywhere else) just saying that&#39;d be some next level screwed up stuff. (Then again Autodale probably would have extinguished them long before they could have reproduced) Food for thought :) Also this video is legit one of the creepiest things ever. I love it.

Comment: My mask would probably say something like &quot;Chronically Logical&quot;, which makes me unexpectedly disliked by many people.<br>In the event that anything emotionally taxing comes up, my composure comes off as unsettling. Also, my explanations are often seen as unnecessary or unwanted, to which people sometimes reply with &quot;Nobody fucking asked&quot;.<br>My priorities also sit in unusual places so people find me harder to understand.<br><br>Anyway, the point of this is &quot;despite the intelligence required for it to happen, it&#39;s seen as undesirable.&quot;.<br>It&#39;s a way of telling that their concept of &quot;Ugly&quot; is quite arbitrary.

-----------------
Author: ron
Comment: Seriously, what the hell is the point of this &quot;dystopian film&quot;?  You assholes successfully destroyed the nuclear family years ago.  Anything depicted in this video has not existed for at least 20 years now, and if we were being really honest, 70 years.    This is the modern equivalent of George Orwells&#39; &quot;two minutes hate&quot;.  You demonize something you murdered in order to pretend it&#39;s a great big threat.   It&#39;s cheap theatrics.  A cheap pretense at courage.  The reality is that you would never say anything truly controversial b/c you know very well that the establishment, which is composed of people just like you, would utterly destroy you in an instant.  So ... pretty art... very lovely ... but ultimately meaningless.

Comment: Theory : This is actually making sense. We want to judge people how the look and make fun of them we don&#39;t see how tormenting this is and we forget about life and only want fame. I&#39;m haveing a mental breakdown right now as you can tell. We only like &quot;pretty&quot; people but we don&#39;t see that judging people by their appearance is unfair and tells nothing about who the ACTUALLY are. Its speaking some truth. And this makes me kinda sad about it. I&#39;m not exactly a &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; person. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m ugly or bad. This is what I call judgement or crap. Nobody should treat someone like this, especially if it&#39;s a friend or someone you know well. Please treat everyone with respect and treat them like you. Except flamingo he does that too much to be honest and that&#39;s what he does. But I get what the are trying to say here and that was a little theory about this video. I thought it would be nice to explain it if you are kinda confused. If you agree I&#39;m glad you do. If you dont that&#39;s ok. „Ää¬∞^~Fin~^¬∞„Äã

Comment: i feel like i have an idea what this film is actually about. it talks about the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù people, intending that they are ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and the ‚Äúugly‚Äù people as ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù. the pretty people keep their masks after they grow up to hide their imperfections so they wouldn‚Äôt be intended as ‚Äúugly‚Äù or not perfect. the people who are ‚Äúugly‚Äù are the ones who TRIED putting up a mask failed miserably and showed their true colors (imperfections). the robot judges you based on your appearance. if you‚Äôre not shown to the world and you‚Äôre a mystery, you‚Äôre pretty. if you fail to put on an act, you‚Äôre ugly.

Comment: Mmmm... video is overall pointless.  Every functioning society eliminates undesirables, be it through segregation, banishment, deportation, permanent imprisonment, or execution.  The only difference here is that they use euphemisms for desirable and undesirable and their definitions of those differ from modern decadent society which is every bit as f***ed up in its own ways.

Comment: I&#39;d say Autodale is more of a &quot;necessary evil to survive&quot; kind of situation. The apocalypse is in full swing, and the matrix of minds in charge acts independently of our current moral codes. Food is scarce, so they only keep people around as long as they are useful. Exceptional minds are added to the matrix and not allowed to live and die like the &quot;drones&quot; of society. Those who do not breed/work as effectively as others are considered a net loss, and the survival of the species is prioritized.<br><br>That&#39;s what makes it scary. You can&#39;t say they are wrong.

Comment: The perspective of &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;pretty&quot; isn&#39;t set. A table will always be a table but unlike a table. Ugly and pretty are opinions and so they will always be different from person to person therefore you can&#39;t really have a concept of what ugly and pretty means only your own concept of it. Everyone is pretty in someone&#39;s eyes and yes everyone is ugly in someone&#39;s eyes as well. You can never please everyone.<br><br>When I realized this I became less dependent on other people&#39;s opinions.

Comment: the feeling i got when it showed the tags on the masks of all the people in the pits was so overwhelming, the message is clear as day. if you are different than what we say you will be, you die. and we don&#39;t care. we have no emotions, and thats how you should be too. emotionless. its often how i feel some of our modern day society acts, maybe not as drastically but still. if you&#39;re different you will be shamed, looked at weird, people will avoid you at all costs because you simply refuse to be like them at the cost of losing your self identity.

Comment: Wow ngl it‚Äôs obviously not this extreme as of yet, but the being pretty thing and only being valued for your looks is sadly too true. Even though it‚Äôs entirely irrelevant for many people watching this video children and the general audience who watch tiktok see hot people dancing or doing weird things and see the praise they receive for their ability or their looks like all the time. While it‚Äôs mostly a fun thing it is clear that some of these people aren‚Äôt famous for their dance skills, but because of what they look like and if not used responsibly to spread positive messages to their audience it can cause a variety of unhealthy mentalities in the people viewing their videos. Not coming for anyone in particular just kinda using this as an example for how real to life this sketch can be.

Comment: After watching these videos I have been asking myself what would I be labeled if I would live in autodale. <br>I came to the conclusion that I would be labeled a pretty, and I think maybe even an exceptional. I don&#39;t have anything the video the video mentioned as an ugly trait, and I think I would be an exceptional because I&#39;m rather intuitive. (Although, the brainwashing is really strong.) What about y&#39;all?

Comment: Okay ima make a long comment here.<br>1. People in the comments, stop calling yourselves ugly. Youre basically trash talking yourself. That can lower self-esteem. Everyone deserves to be happier about themselves.<br>2. Theres no such thing as an ugly person to me. Everyone, every single living breathing being (even animals) is unique. With &quot;perfect people&quot; everywhere, wheres the fun in life? Everyone should know that they&#39;re beautiful. Always was beautiful, and always will be. Never let anyone bring you down, you are awesome, you know that.<br>3. I&#39;m not saying anything about god.<br>4. For anyone who calls someone ugly, they&#39;re are just jealous that they person they are teasing has something special they dont. A heart that&#39;s whole. <br>5. Dont commit self harm. You have a life. Enjoy it and be free. It&#39;s your life. Don&#39;t care what others think of you because this is a unique world, so be a unique person.<br><br><br>I hope this helps and I bet nobody will read this üíï

Comment: ‚ÄúAre we sitting comfortably? Good. Welcome citizens of Autodale to this PSA, children, look around the room. Look at your father; he likes to read the newspaper and kick his feet up after a hard‚Äôs day work, he provides for your family - your father is pretty. And then children, look at your mother; isn‚Äôt her cooking splendid? She also keeps the house clean and she reads bedtime stories every night - your mother is pretty. And now children, look at yourselves; you‚Äôre young. You laugh, you play, you may scrape your knees from time to time, you have friends, you and your friends get up to all sorts of playful mischief. One day children,you will grow up to just like one of your parents and you will build a family of you‚Äôre own - one day you will be pretty. Now finally my pretties, look outside at your lovely neighbours, you‚Äôre pretty, you‚Äôre pretty, you‚Äôre pretty. But alas children, not everyone is pretty; some are ugly, we don‚Äôt want uglies, do we children? You are ugly, you are ugly, you are ugly. We take the uglies away so that you and your friends and your neighbours and your family can stay pretty; remember that children. And this this concludes today‚Äôs PSA citizens of Autodale.‚Äù

Comment: wait i think i just noticed what Autodale is. Autodale is the neighbourhood or town of people who are &#39;perfect&#39; in societies eyes. the robots are society and they kill the &#39;ugly&#39; people. this is because society (aka the robots) don&#39;t like people who have something wrong with them and that could cause trouble towards the place.

Comment: I haven&#39;t seen anyone comment this before, but I think this video depicts what people are treated like, when they&#39;re ugly. Fat. Too thin. Deaf. Mute. Have you seen them get treated normally? Most of these people, are treated not normally. I know this is a bad example, but is there anyone in any movie that you watch, not good looking? Is there anytime you thought that YOU were pretty? Loved? And not low self esteemed? This is what are humanity has turned into, dividing us into to types of people. Pretty and Ugly. Smh.

Comment: I just thought of something. In order to save supplies and resources, does the robot use population control from time to time? Encourage having two-three children per house hold when they need more people for the labor force, and only one child per house hold when the population starts getting too big? Because now that I think of it, I think this is the only house hold that has 2 children, when all the other ones we&#39;ve seen have only one. They&#39;re likely twins, but still, does other households have 2 or more kids?

Comment: for some reason this dystopian world shows how the society is today. <br><br>the society judges and separates people on how they look like and their flaws.<br>-the robot separates the pretty and ugly (pretty stays, ugly dies) <br><br>this fantasized dystopian world is actually happening in present times which is quite saddening and terrifying at the same time.

Comment: so... I took this video as sarcasm for society. it&#39;s human nature to seek the beauty over anything, yet beauty also has the dark side. we always believed that having ideal, pretty life, means to grow up as &quot;normal&quot; adult. to build a family with the father that can provide well, and good mum who never complaints. they are expected to be just like that when they become adults.<br><br>but there&#39;s no such perfection in this world. youngsters never exist without the elders. there&#39;s also people who&#39;s depressed, who&#39;s gay, who&#39;s divorced, who can&#39;t afford simple, cozy home. much more than people who considered have ideal life in the video. so what they gonna do? they tossed aside them off of society because they don&#39;t bring any advantages. that&#39;s why they tossed them to big holes, it feels like otracizing them from the world. then, those &quot;ideal&quot; adults using masks to hide their faces because they&#39;re no longer people who can control their own lives. they lived for the standard. which is why the childs aren&#39;t using masks, since they have no idea what would they turned into when they grow up.

Comment: Nowadays it&#39;s all about being skinny and having a long dick. And being straight and being perfect. I hate it as well. People nowadays are so judgemental on people&#39;s looks. I should know, because a lot of people make fun of me because I am chubby. Nowadays are just stupid. Literally, you walk in somewhere when you are chubby and everyone looks at you and goes ew. If somebody who was skinny walks in, everyone looks and thinks oh he/she is sexy. I hate it how people judge everyone almost 100% of people&#39;s looks.

Author: Melkior Wiseman
Comment: I wonder if the robots of Autodale are smart enough (or deranged enough) to worm their way out of this chain of logic?:<br>* Death is Ugly.<br>* You robots cause almost all of the death in Autodale.<br>* You robots are the cause of most of the Ugly in Autodale.<br>* You robots are Ugly.<br>* All that is Ugly in Autodale must be destroyed.<br>If you wanted to end the series, and maybe end it on a more hopeful note, that might be a way.  Have a robot discover something written by a child which follows that logic.  Robots begin breaking down as they try unsuccessfully to resolve the conflict between them trying to keep Autodale &quot;Pretty&quot; and the evidence that they are &quot;Ugly.&quot;<br>While it&#39;s perfectly possible for a machine to handle such a contradiction by simply ignoring/disbelieving the evidence, the robots of Autodale seem to be too sophisticated for them to be able to just dismiss such obvious evidence once it&#39;s pointed out to them.  Yes, it seems contradictory, but a simpler robot would be able to ignore the conflict of logic far better than a more sophisticated robot could, and the more sophisticated the robot&#39;s thinking is, the more difficult it would be for the robot to ignore the conflict.<br>But it seems that the robots are controlled by an organic, so perhaps the robots don&#39;t even think.  Perhaps everything is directly controlled by a lunatic who is impervious to logic.

Comment: I love your animations they are superb you should make a show, like 30 mins long, of how it is to live in autodale, regulations, laws, the story and life of autodale.<br><br>I think it would be cool, and from that it can become a game, where you are placed in autodale, you are a child, being raised by your parents, when one day they are taken away because they are too old or one child you passed your genes you die etc, you then have to live and somehow survive until your adulthood ... then you are one that tries to escape the program to be free....but everyone is then after you.

Comment: Pretty is a funny word right? It always chance by places you go. Cuz i know an koren pretty person may not be pretty in usa or usa pretty may not be pretty in Pakistan. Pretty is always different but pretty is not really pretty is just the same as normal. If we all look the same then we would all be pretty cuz no one would want to call themselves ugly. And pretty hate the word wierd, what pretty persons find ugly(they call it wierd), they find it disgusting. They want everyone to look like them. And just bc u are a pretty person doesn&#39;t mean i am talking abt u so don&#39;t attack me

Comment: Sterile/gay/old means they wont make children to continue the cicle so the machines classifies them as ugly (not working) because this society is based on <br>1-having children<br>2- taking care of the children <br>3- becoming old (you cant have children)<br>4- getting rid of the old people (now ugly) and let their child replace them.<br>(Explained by the author on his last video) (just saying he is not an homofobe so dont be mad at him, he just wanted to create a dystopia*)<br><br>*dystopia:<br>an imagined state or society in which there is great suffering or injustice<br><br>Sterile/gay/old people cant take care of orphans because there are not orphans in this world<br><br>So yea this is PRETTY messed up...

Comment: Almost all the comments are silly little jabs at the serious society flaws pointed out in this video. People here are all calling themselves ugly and while I understand that our generation is so used to making such self degrading jokes, this video pointed out that it isn‚Äôt fair to ourselves. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are like one of the numerous people that this video pointed out society finds ugly, because the point is that you aren‚Äôt. We are NOT ugly. I don‚Äôt believe in that word unless it is describing a rude, ugly person. When did that word start determining our appearances? I don‚Äôt care if it always did, the point is I am determined to not see it that way. Though even if you wanted to think of it as all of us are ‚Äúpretty‚Äù, I hate the labels that society chooses to chain us down with.

Comment: Technology improves and improves each day. Until we reached to a artificial intelligence, our future can be destroyed by robots. They want us to be perfect,flawless, and pretty. They throw out the ugly,worthless,and helpless people without giving them a chance, so they kill them with no mercy...that&#39;s the reality we need to be aware of especially if we&#39;re making a robot more superior than us. We should make a wise decision about it or else the human race and population will decrease, since the robot wants a perfect family and all. So please take care of the future properly and make wise decision for us not to fall and become even more blind. Because we&#39;re living in vain

Comment: This is very clearly about society‚Äôs standards on what being ‚Äúpretty‚Äù is. If you don‚Äôt fit into that criteria, you are cast out and ashamed for not being pretty like other people, and how they feel worthless over the things that are natural parts of people that in reality give everyone beautiful individuality. In this society, if you aren‚Äôt what is perceived as a perfect human, then you‚Äôre worthless, when in reality its nowhere near true.

Comment: The concept of this video, with all the happy-faced masks and people dumped into a hole and the giant overlord robot, I think, is that when someone gets put in such a great power, they force their standards onto people. As a result, nobody can accept difference, nobody can accept people for who they really are. And the definitions of ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and ‚Äúugly‚Äù are forever twisted into that of the ‚Äúoverlord robot‚Äù.

Comment: you know, this dystopia must be must be very new if about half of the problems that makes them &quot;ugly&quot; still exist. if this dystpoia has been going on for at least 100 years, things like being fat, unemployed, divorced, etc wouldnt be an issue since everyone would be so brainwashed into whats going on in the dystopia that none of these things could happen. now, one thing i can say is if humans were bosses and wives somehow met a guy who had different tastes then the regular men or vice versa(same for bosses) this could mean you could send someone to death at will (although, the wives would die too since they are divorced)<br><br><br>like ive said before, amazing work cant wait to watch more!

The children are the ones who are the target of propaganda here, masks represents as something that hide your true nature/feelings.Children are unmasked they are unaware of the hard truths that they have to face but these masks will become part of them eventually.

Comment: We are all beautiful in our own way, it&#39;s a shame how society brainwash us and try 5o define pretty, we are made in the image of God, a unique likeness. . Even as beyonce say pretty hurts.. Because we can&#39;t truly be ourselves. And that robot is ugly, he himself should fall in the ditch.

Comment: Why are dystopian futures always so commonly referenced to the 1950s? <br>Idk maybe because of the strong gender, ethnic, and orientation roles that were created.

Comment: few questions. <br>Divorced, how does that work in this world?<br>1. Being Divorced, does the person who request it survive? <br>2. Does the person who request it know the other one will be labeled as an ugly and be shoved into a pit?<br>3. If both couples agree on a divorce, do they both go into a pit? <br>4.If they both go into a pit, do they know what agreed on will make  both be labeled as ugly? <br>5. What happen one cheats on another and someone request a divorced and they both found new partners? do none of them go into a pit?

Another was deaf and another was blind. These are not things you can change. They are permanent. But they don‚Äôt stop you from being a citizen in society, they can still work or help with children they just have a disability. This was amazing to watch and gave me chills.

Comment: As per this video, not being pretty means straying from what society deems &quot;normal&quot;. Parents are &quot;pretty&quot; when they embody their gender roles. Children are &quot;pretty&quot; when their innocence leads them to idolize these norms, an act of manipulation by authority. People are not &quot;pretty&quot; when they hold their own bona fide thoughts. In general, &quot;pretty&quot; is synonymous with the masses, their thoughts, their behaviors, and straying from them, being your own genuine person, whether physical or mental, is not &quot;pretty&quot;. Ngl this short film really gives off some 1984 vibez.

Comment: I look at all those comments that are making memes out of this video. But guys that&#39;s serious. Our society, us, everyone judges people with no  reason and cuts them off. That&#39;s not fair. You can&#39;t cut off someone because they are fat, old, disabled, autistic, gay, transsexual, poor, believes in other God, belongs to another country, because they are not what we define as perfect or beautiful. That is just cruel.<br><br>Sorry for my English, they are not my mother language.

So if there was more &#39;pretty&#39; people and less &#39;ugly&#39; people, the ugly would now be called pretty. Just like how chubby ladies were seen pretty and strong back in the day.<br><br>AMAZING VIDEO!

Sometimes I end up crying because I don&#39;t know how to talk with him. Still Lord chose me to be around him there must be something special in me I get a chance to help him. That what we are trained in my political party &quot;help your people help them as long you live true meaning of being politician serve the people &quot;. I hope someday he becomes alright then he will forget me but it&#39;s alright I did positive thing for society I helped a human being. Great film you made.

Comment: Then you see the face on the T.V., what they show you, a pretty sweet little girl, with freckles and all, she looks healthy, normal, and like everyone else, not even wearing a mask, like some of the other children, the face they show you to make you think it is normal and if they saw the disfigured face behind it all, it would ruin their ideologies or turn against her or do something to stop the mass murder and genocide of their kind.
-----------------
Author: GutiePie TTV
Comment: I think I know why the woman behind it all was shown, she is a woman in leadership, she is in charge, she is disfigured, she does not look like everyone else, she is naked, which is considered indecent, she could be scary to a lot of people if they saw her, to me, she&#39;s pretty but scary a bit, she is some of the things for instance the people under her are considered Ugly for.

Comment: What I think the short film represents <br><br>1. We are told by the media on television to put pretty and sexy people on more higher regard then ugly and not sexy people<br><br>2. We are told by media on television to a hold a certain standard that rejects the ‚Äúugly‚Äù people in the pits<br><br>3. The big women looking thing is a metaphor for what television has illustrated as to being the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù women or the ‚Äùhot‚Äù guy everyone wants to be or have and often gets the most power for being the ‚Äúprettiest‚Äù<br><br>4. Television tells us to focus on the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù things in this world and to forget the ‚Äúugly‚Äù this no one wants to acknowledge<br><br>5. The ‚Äúpretties‚Äù are white people and the media of the time is telling them how ‚Äúpretty the world is while totally not acknowledging the ‚Äúuglies‚Äù which are minorities who have to deal with how ‚Äúugly people‚Äù in this world can be, and the ‚Äúuglies‚Äù in the whole are dead due to the result of genocide <br><br>I may be wrong but it was fun writing this

Comment: The meaning of the cartoon is kind of not clear. Is it so bad to be pretty? And why do roboters leave only pretty people to live in this wierd society? What criteria do they use to select them from the others? Familymaking, householdkeeping and having a job is not inherent for nice people only, it&#39;s normal for all, but somehow roboters leave only nice and pretty ones. And what do roboters do, if there is, for example, a pretty gay? Btw, why do these roboters even need people in the world where roboters reign, for what purpose? It is not shown. To many questions in this plot swallow the point of view of the creators of the cartoon completely.

Comment: LOL. This was posted to reddit&#39;s r/misanthropy and got LAMBASTED for being MEAN and BIGOTED to attractive people. <br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll be the first to say that yes, pretty people suffer. I&#39;m grateful that I was never at risk of being human trafficked. But something in the contextual brain center gets lost when all you have to do to get a job is smile during the interview. You really don&#39;t appreciate the effort that others put into life to get by. You can&#39;t seem to contextualize abstract presentations that try to make a metaphorical point that has nothing to do with your concrete endowments. In fact, said endowment is more likely to make you have trouble with abstract constructs simply because you spend your life hyper focused maintaining attention for material reward, rather than learning valid survival skills. That part is the fault of people like me..the ugly majority. We are complicit in giving you pretty people unearned status that you cannot maintain on your own, and you will cease to have when you grow older and become one of us. <br><br><br><br>But the fact still remains. Nobody hits their face with a shovel to end the horror and painful life struggle that comes with the privilege of being shag worthy.

Comment: Jeez this is creepy as heck! From the masks to the death pits and that creepy robot at the end, everything just felt so unnerving. I like the black and white touch, however. The animation and story is good, too - it says a lot about the workings of a society in only a few minutes, and the fact that the dialogue only comes from the antagonists&#39; POV makes it a whole lot more interesting. Nobody seems to have any problems with what&#39;s going on. Do those kids and their parents even know what happens to &quot;uglies&quot;? Something tells me they don&#39;t. Anyway, good job! This short film is amazing.<br><br><br>Edit: I noticed that there are more videos set in this universe! At least, I think so...? Haven&#39;t watched them yet, but I definitely will...

Must we all die just because of the things we are flawed, and not look at the good things about this world? Don‚Äôt people have loved ones who cared or have cared for them? Why can‚Äôt others just enjoy what this place has to offer, and not be a pessimistic person?

Comment: So, this is basically society. If we continue like this, it&#39;s going to end just like the animation. Some people hate gay people, retard people, fat people, etc. But they never think: does this person have a life? Problems? Rights? Well, they do, actually. And they deserve more than you, because you&#39;re hating them, just because they&#39;re different. But... Aren&#39;t you?

Comment: Everyone&#39;s saying what they&#39;d do at the pit and stuff and I&#39;m just like, they probably kill you before you even see the pit considering if they just threw you in the pit and expected you to die, they&#39;d be wrong.<br><br>For one, pit doesn&#39;t look that deep. You&#39;d probably survive the fall if you didn&#39;t land face first. Still I guess a bunch of people would die since you&#39;d break a bunch of bones and you wouldn&#39;t be able to climb out anyway.<br><br>But second, once the pit is filled up to a certain amount, the bodies would cushion your fall and would pile up high enough so someone could climb out and revolt. So they wouldn&#39;t risk that would they?<br><br>How they kill you, it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess. I think they poison you because none of them have physical wounds prior to being thrown and they seem to be thrown in one at a time, and the city can hardly waste gas for one person to die.

Comment: This video shows how if people arent like how they &#39;should be&#39; (like what they were in the &#39;olden times&#39; such as the women doing all the cleaning  and cooking. The father being the proud man who provides for the families and the children who arent pretty like their parents as they arent perfect. Anybody other than this is killed and thrown into a pit (discriminated/ignored) If you look at the tags on the masks of the people. Things like divorced, retarded, stupid, ugly, fat, gay,

Comment: what the fuck why would they allow their citizens to be ugly if they have control like why not outlaw divorce unless you&#39;re allowed to divorce someone and throw them in the pit. i get killing people with genetic defects but why not kill them as children also it&#39;s stupid to throw them in a pit. i feel like people always forget about slave labor or other uses of humans, but  iguess it&#39;s just a robot fucking around not having a goal other than fun

Comment: So I think I kinda get this, the town of ‚ÄúAutodale‚Äù is supposed to represent a perfect society. The people wear masks to try to make them more ‚Äúpretty‚Äù or to fit in with the rest. But... the ones who aren‚Äôt or are not accepted into society because of ‚Äúissues‚Äù and are simply gotten rid of and seem to be publicly criticized by the town. or in are case society. Society now if you don‚Äôt fit the perfect person role that is expected on some people. You are criticized and ‚Äúthrown out‚Äù into a outcast position. Autodale represents life today.<br><br><br><br><br>BUT THATS JUST A THEORY! A GAME THEO- <br><br><b>robot yeets me into hole</b>

Comment: Its interesting how ‚Äúugly‚Äù in this story isn‚Äôt just being unattractive, but also just being not the complete picture perfect and traditional person (having uniqueness in all regards for a person makes them ‚Äúugly‚Äù). Most videos like this would only focus on physical attractiveness, but this concept has more to do with general ‚Äúperfection‚Äù being considered pretty.

That‚Äôs why they said stay ‚Äòpretthey‚Äô , which means that follow the stupid rules.

Comment: Out of all honesty, I sometimes think of such worlds like &quot;Autodale&quot;. The possibility of taking over the world and having everything in order and absolute perfection, where nothing is out of place and imperfect. And if there are any major problems, it&#39;s simple, we get rid of them. If you have read or watched the book &quot;A wrinkle in time&quot; you might recognize &quot;The Camazotz Planet&quot;, a perfect world with no imperfections. A pretty world.

Comment: This got dark real quick-<br>But this is a really good video.<br>I like how it talks about the pressure of being &#39;pretty&#39; and the discrimination against people who aren&#39;t defined as &#39;pretty&#39; so subtly, just as if it were another advertisement on TV. It really brings this topic into light, plus, the animation is well-fit with this video. Great job on making this!

Comment: At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Vh_w_Qb1A&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>, pay close attention to the little girl‚Äôs facial expressions. Whilst her parents and her brother are accepting of the program, she starts looking a little confused. A dissatisfied, maybe even scared, emotion comes to her face. This shows that while everyone else is okay, she isn‚Äôt on board with the program.<br><br>In other words, she sees the community for what it really is: a horrible, corrupted place. But then, she looks around at her parents and brother, and sees them happily smiling. Slowly, a satisfied smile comes to her face and you begin to think that she‚Äôs brainwashed too. But then, a few seconds later, that scared, skeptical expression quickly returns for a split second. <br><br>I think this shows that she is pretending to be on board with the society, because she‚Äôll be punished if she rebels. But she knows her city is messed up, and she knows she has to pretend to be okay with it. <br><br>And something that also makes me curious are the masks. As you see, all the adults have masked. But a few children, particularly these ones, don‚Äôt have masks. I think the mask is supposed to represent that the adults have lost their individuality, and are now brainwashed by the system. They‚Äôre no longer normal people, just slaves of their society. <br><br>But the children...they don‚Äôt have masks. This shows that the children haven‚Äôt been brainwashed yet, and they still have bits of themselves left. They still have a chance to save themselves, and not all of them agree with the system, like the girl.<br><br>Or maybe I‚Äôm just over-analyzing this.

And the drawings are amazing. <br>But if I can make one critic: it doesn&#39;t really make sense to see and hear a film image in a TV screen. I understand that it creates a certain atmosphere and relates to a certain time, but it doesn&#39;t make sense. <br>All the rest was really great though!

Comment: There&#39;s no such thing as being perfect or pretty all you have to do for you to be pretty is be <i>yourself</i> ! It doesn&#39;t matter if your gay, fat, or a different race, you&#39;re all pretty in your unique way! Don&#39;t listen to those people who say bad things about their either jealous of you or they are going through a ruff time or are they think their all that even tho they&#39;re not so just be yourself no matter what!

The message of this is really deep. so we know its a dystopia, now dystopia is sameness, everything must be the same, and people who are, (just like the video shows)gay, deaf, divorced,or being different is wrong.it&#39;s saying deep down (IN MY THOUGHTS!!!) don&#39;t be same you can be gay,lesbian,or whatever. as long as your being you thats all that matters deep down,so dont try an act like someone whos not you. &lt;3

Comment: This film came out on the day of my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I had gotten a notification because I had recently watched a ton of creepy videos. This was at two in the morning and some of the other people at her party were interested so we watched it. I thought it would just be some creepy video. This is actually my favorite video on the internet thank you so fucking much.

Comment: I have a theory that the &quot;humans&quot; are also robots. My evidence?<br>1. This place is literally called &quot;Autodale&quot;.<br>2. In the second entry in the series, after a mother tells her son a bedtime story to ease his fear of monsters, she says &quot;You won&#39;t run from your monster, will you sweetie?&quot; Which means that she was not brainwashed into thinking the system is good. If she was brainwashed, she would not regard the system as a monster. No, <i>she was programmed.</i><br>3. If the &quot;humans&quot; were actually robots, it would fit with the theme of this series: perfection, flawlessness, being &quot;pretty&quot;. Humans are flawed in nature, therefore it is impossible for them to fit the system&#39;s definition of &quot;pretty&quot;.<br>I&#39;m binge watching this whole series again. I&#39;ll come back with more evidence if I find it.

Comment: It doesn‚Äôt even matter about being pretty. The only thing that matter is being pretty on the inside. Being pretty on the outside won‚Äôt last long. You‚Äôll get older or probably have an accident or illness or somewhat. Stupid idiots never listen to this advice and always choose what they think is best without any thought or mind onto their choice. Gender equality is one thing and Gay marriage are another problem too. I really don‚Äôt think the upcoming future will be good for us if we keep acting like slobs. Corruption, droughts, poverty, crime, suicide, war, pollution, global warming and habitat loss to animals. These are the things that are wrong with us. God has only one mistake. Humans.

Comment: Everyone‚Äôs beautiful. Today‚Äôs beauty standards are tall and skinny, but people made those up. It wasn‚Äôt embedded into the earth at the beginning of time. Cleopatra was not attractive according to scientists, however back then maybe cleopatra was beautiful to society. Don‚Äôt you get it? We the human race were the ones who made beauty standards. Not some greater being. But maybe in the greater being‚Äôs mind everyone is beautiful. Because they created us. I‚Äôm not trying to start a religious rant here and I‚Äôm sorry if I offended you. The point is that we are all beautiful and in reality there is nothing that defines beauty. The beauty standards today and called one thing: opinions.

Comment: I feel like the masks resemble law and if you break the law you become &#39;ugly&#39;<br><br>It also goes another way with all people not being perfect or being fat, disabled or generally different being &#39;ugly&#39; because they are different.<br><br>I personally would be a &#39;ugly because I have curly hair and mental issues from the past. Being &#39;ugly&#39; doesn&#39;t mean you are a bad person it means you stick out from society and it can be something to be proud of to not be a copy of the next person along.

Comment: If they are so pretty, why do they have to wear masks? and behind those masks, you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell who is disfigured and who isn&#39;t. So the premise makes little sense. Not to mention that a) this is such an old idea; b) unfortunately, it has been proven that people generally want pretties around themselves, so sorry, it&#39;s human nature.

Comment: Me ha gustado mucho, es como una critica social en la que se√±ala como el sistema se dedica a oprimir sistematicamente a aquellas personas que por unas determinadas caracteristicas son rechazadas por la sociedad y actua como una especie de seleccion natural de modo que solo puedan sobrevivir aquellos que sean considerados aptos para el sistema.<br>Curiosamente este mismo sistema parece haber desarrollado una nueva forma de opresion al utilizar a aquellas personas a las que antes oprimia y convertirlas en opresores utilizando el victimismo y la correccion politica, de forma que sea mucho mas dificil distinguir a los opresores de los oprimidos.

Comment: Have you read the book called &quot;In comfort of Mary&quot; by Bethany Ford its on Amazon and when you look it up always put the authors name in as well as the title of the book. Interesting reading. Bethany suffered worse mental, neglect, physical, emotional abuse by her parents. She is told that she is fat, ugly, worthless, useless and better off dead. Bethany suffered verbal abuse from her mother and at school. She has suffered victimized everywhere she went. She was beaten, starved and treated as a slave to, she wasn&#39;t allowed to have friends or freedom either, she lived like a prisoner. She never went to school hardly because she was made to keep the house clean and tidy, look after her two brothers who verbal abuse her calling &quot;gormless, slag, smelly bitch&quot; they spoke to her like muck all the time even visitors started being abusive towards Bethany. They would kick, punch, throw hot drinks at her and hot food at her saying its a last meal get used to it.

Comment: This would actually be a pretty interesting scenario... to guide human evolution for pleasing appearance. It doesn&#39;t have to be death, but could be a comitee deciding who is allowed to reproduce and who is not, based on intelligence, appearance and maybe some other beneficial factors. <br>Maybe another comitee deciding who is fit to raise kids and who is not, so that those that are not allowed to reproduce can still adopt.<br>But with genetic engineering on the rise, such a solution will soon no longer be necessary

Comment: What is this B.S. !?<br>Most people in the whole western world are a bit fatter, gay, of other ethnic or religious background , short, etc : they are all different !<br>90%of all people are doing their effing best to get along, be tolerant and don&#39;t care about these differences, as long as there is &quot;live and let live&quot; around and a big effort of everybody to fit in with eachother, without having to  give up your  inividuality.<br><br>The west as it is now, is th√© place to be yourself since a long time already !<br><br>This film pictures the struggle of &#39;68 , not of 2019 !

Comment: This reminded me of the Uglies series by Scott Westerfield. It&#39;s about a dystopia where regular people are considered &quot;Uglies&quot; who need to get plastic surgery to become &quot;Pretties&quot;. Except the surgery basically turns you into a complacent airhead who just wants to party all the time and never contribute anything of substance. It&#39;s a good series, would recommend.

Author: Sini
Comment: Being in a dystopian world like this would really be depressing, having expectations to be a certain thing that stereotypes what society must be like, is just sad. Realizing the meaning of this animation though brings me to a conclusion, people are afraid of what‚Äôs different, almost like in real life. When people see something different they‚Äôll turn it down, and not accept the fact something different is in their life, leading to a lot of problems we have in this world today. Not accepting difference. A really beautiful animation, and I hope the artist gets more recognition for their works, on this animation, including other of his projects as well.

Comment: Well......i think Theresa May Hired CAPTIA to access everyone to make sure their &quot;pretty&quot; enough. Sadly im not pretty enough as i have borderline personality disorder so now im struggling to survive in a so called &quot;devloped&quot; country. I honestly think the Tories should bring back the gas chmbers as at least it got rid of the sick elderly and infirm humanely where as Capita takes away their lifelines and makes them either starve to death or mentally tortures them till they comit suicide. If you dont believe me look at the UK suicide rate of infirm people waiting to get ther benifits reinstated.<br>WAKE UP PEOPLE TO THE TORTURE!!!!

I ended up liking him but then people got mad at me because...you get it. But I was happy. I had someone to love me. Idk. I thought it went along with the theme?

The world is picky, for some, you have to be perfect, you have to be beautiful, popular, smart, skinny, brave. They put our expectations so high that you can hardly reach them... great job on this animation, I love it!!

Comment: In a way we are all &quot;ugly&quot; so shouldn&#39;t we all be on the pit? We&#39;re all different in some way, so you can&#39;t define someone as ugly or pretty. We are all unique.

Comment: The world will be like this soon. We&#39;re expected to be perfect and criticised for being anything other than perfect. It&#39;s only a matter of time before genetic and neural implants are made to try and make us perfect, then if that fails anyone who isn&#39;t seen as perfect will be killed. And this will happen sooner than you think. I don&#39;t think we have long left before life is like this. I&#39;d say 10-15 years at the most. It&#39;s a terrifying but very real future.

Comment: This video, is very... &#39;hitting&#39;. Well, the animation is awesome, but the main idea, is dark. And it hit me in the heart. I see it describes the world more, for people who are racist. If you read the labels on the heads of the dead people, it says &#39; Gay, Fat, Old, Depressed,  Disfigured, Disabled &#39; . It&#39;s just like the real world. People bullying others for all those things... and It&#39;s just because they are &#39; different &#39; .

Comment: I think this is a overall message to society to tell us that this is the way that we treat each other. ( the robots being society) the children don‚Äôt have masks on which is an indication that they are the most vulnerable ones and the most effected ones. We should just all together stop judging ppl by something in which they have absolutely not control over. Thank u and have a blessed day. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Comment: I&#39;ve seen more dystopian and apocalyptic shorts than I can count ... but your videos have always stood out to me.  Maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re brutally honest and entirely too possible, or maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re simply extraordinarily well made and, even better, well told, but whatever it is that makes them so powerful, they&#39;re among my personal faves of all time.  Thank you for this.

Comment: The father is pretty because he is the ‚Äúperfect father figure‚Äù. He makes all the money and provides for the family. They call him pretty because ‚Äòpretty‚Äô is a positive word. We all want to be called pretty so we all will copy what the father does.<br><br>The mother is pretty because she cooks the food and has kids. She is fulfilling what the society wants her to be, and she will be called the positive word ‚Äòpretty‚Äô so we will be like her.<br><br>The children aren‚Äôt pretty yet because they aren‚Äôt functioning in society yet. But in order to be pretty like their parents they have to fulfill societies expectations for them.<br>Those is the pit, the depressed, gay, sterile, disfigures, blind, deaf, they are all ugly because they can‚Äôt fulfill what society wants them to be. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt fulfill what society wants them to be will be thrown in the pit.

Comment: Shame one you Dead Sound ,this film represents people based on their appearance. You are basically saying that if you are not pretty you are not good enough for this world. I know this is supposed to be a film and all but this just offends personally, God created us equal. We are God&#39;s creation and you are mocking the way that God has created us. Everybody is equally pretty, we all have are flaws there is no perfect.

Comment: If you think about it differently, like:<br><br>Say our collective goal among all humans is decidedly to make as many advancements in intelligence and for us to live as long and efficiently as possible.<br>Then a society like this would be somewhat ideal. Not in all aspects, but only in those that affect us genetically. Such as diseases like AIDS, certain deformations, and etc. <br>The only way to stop certain things like these from continuing to afflict people, is to stop those who are afflicted from procreating. <br><br>(no I don&#39;t support an ideal like this, it&#39;s purely theoretical)

Author: Parmishan
Comment: I&#39;m assuming that people born outside of the city are seen by other people as freaks even tho they are just people themselves which could be a metaphor for they immigrants are treated or something and people that live in autodale see each other  wearing masks unless there siblings because in the video the little boy and girl weren&#39;t wearing masks the entire time but the other kids were so It can&#39;t be just a &quot;kids don&#39;t see each other wearing masks thing&quot; and plus I&#39;m still very confused whether or not the mask is a physical thing or not because the freaks could actually pick up the masks and collect them and it seems the mask has an affect on the blood splatter from the people in the pit. To be honest I started righting this because I was confident that I knew what was going on but I don&#39;t know shitüíÄmaybe the giant robot lady&#39;s produce some sort of imagination field that changes people&#39;s perspective on things and makes them lose grasp of what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t which led to other towns destroying there giant lady&#39;s and intern themselves with autodale being one of the last surviving towns with this system in place because for one it is working seeing as how there&#39;s tons of people on autodale even tho the kill a bunch of uglys and assuming that the freaks are people there aren&#39;t really a lot of them without the giant lady&#39;s to do whatever they do for the people. That&#39;s just my thoughts lol

Comment: Title: &quot;Being Pretty&quot; <br><br>Me: BRUH THE CREEPY MASK FACES THEY HAVE ARE UGLY
-----------------
Author: Multifandom39
Comment: Majority of people grow up and try to live up to societies standards. They&#39;re referred to as &#39;pretty&#39; but in reality they&#39;re all robotics: copies of what everyone wants you to be. Putting on a display of false happiness and changing or hiding your authentic identity to best fit in is what these &#39;pretty&#39; people have done. The &#39;ugly&#39; are people who don&#39;t fit into the categories of what everyone wants them to be. Whether the person is overweight, short, disabled, dark skinned, gay, transgender, or anything that isn&#39;t considered to be pretty fall into the category of &#39;ugly&#39;. Those &#39;pretty&#39; people oppress, bully, or outright harm the &#39;ugly&#39; people. That or those considered &#39;pretty&#39; push the &#39;ugly&#39; into such a dismal state of mind they decide to leave this backwards, horribly oppressive, and cruel world. <br><br>We should change that. Regardless of someone&#39;s skin tone, religion, IQ, sexual orientation, gender identity, wealth, social status, or anything in between, we should all be treated equally. We are all people and should be treated as such. We need to find peace and compassion for everyone <del>even if we don&#39;t know their struggles personally</del> and create a peaceful world where we all can coexist without having to change our identities to be &#39;pretty&#39; or &#39;normal&#39;. No person should ever have to feel inferior or like they&#39;re not good enough to continue living. We are all here right now. We should do what&#39;s right and try and eradicate the hate in our minds and continue to a peaceful society.

Author: lukelblitz
Comment: so after watching the entire series(being pretty,no monsters,children&#39;s toys and dont feed the freaks) my hypothesis is that every city had a robot like the one in autodale,and that the robots are a kind of hivemind,controlling and regulating the city after what terrible acident caused the apocalypse.the robots need minds to think alike inside the city to stay docile and &quot;contained&quot;,otherwise it may awaken and try to scape,as seem in dont feed the freaks where it has several giant robots crawling in pieces.i also believe that somehow,the robots make a &quot;bubble of reality&quot; around them,keeping whatever weirdness that is in between the cities at bay,as there is nothing like upside down world or reverted gravity inside the cities or close to the robots,therefore the protagonist of dont feed the freaks makes camp under the hand of a dead robot.the fact that they are a hivemind mean that they need to purge anyone that thinks differently,otherwise the robot will get upset and try to scape the town,leading to chaos and the death of the town.thats also why autodale is deeply xenophobic against outsiders,calling them &quot;freaks&quot; and whatnot,since adopting more cultures into their collective mind would cause the robot to awaken.

Comment: don&#39;t kill me for this.. but this is our society... or what I see it as. We are so judgemental and hate eachother for our differences. Different people, like me are treated terribly and no one accepts them for who they are, for example I used to be a lesbian cause I could never get a guy. I was treated terribly and made fun of... I was an ugly I guess. We really need to stop doing such bad things like judging people for who they are when they haven&#39;t harmed you, and we need to think more about what we do to others.

Comment: That&#39;s deep. The &#39;imperfect&#39; people are ugly. Those who were disabled, gay, divorced. Ugly is a metaphor for those who aren&#39;t perfect.<br><br>This is a dystopian world where everyone is brainwashed to be the same, individuality is bad; It&#39;s ugly.

Everything else is shoved away, kind of into a pit like they&#39;re using in this animation. It&#39;s sad, but true.

Comment: I was scrolling through the comments and stumbled upon some questions for this video that I can probably answer.<br>- the reason that gays, disfigured, and so on where thrown into the pit is not becasue who ever made this is against them, its because in todays society we often discriminate against them.<br>-they are wearing masks to show that we all want to be like the reat and not be different. We often try to change ourselves to look like each other...<br>I will answer and other questions

Comment: This is pretty well done, but boy that symbolism isn&#39;t subtle at all. The main complex is obviously meant to be phallic in reference to &quot;da patriarchy&quot;, and the end shows a bunch of people who are anything other than in perfect health or straight/cis/whatever being thrown in a pit.<br><br>Not sure what the message was here, but it&#39;s pretty much the opposite today where articles are openly written about why white people and men suck, meanwhile people get called racist for saying the actor chosen for Starfire in that new TITANS series doesn&#39;t fit the character well.

Comment: Question, I know the gay thing is like &quot;WHOA WHOA WHOA A LOTTA PEOPLE ARE GAY, YOUR THROWING AWAY A LOT OF YOUR POPULATION&quot; but...What about Bisexual&#39;s? They can be Straight AND gay. It&#39;s either Throw away a halfgood citizen, or throw away a citizen that can be strung towards the straight side. I honestly hate the fact that this dystopia throws away Gay&#39;s, Fat, deaf, blind people, etc. Because a lot of my friends have at least some disability or disadvantage that at least makes them seen or stereotyped differently. DARN I T DYSTOPIAN SOCIETIES.

Comment: Oh for ffs, it&#39;s not about ACTUALLY being ugly people. The people in the pit have the same masks as the main family. The term &quot;ugly&quot; is used as propaganda (I suppose by the mother) to make children connect the concepts of homosexuality, suffering, unemployement or illnes as &quot;bad&quot; things not to deal with, that should be shoved under the rug

Comment: Makes me think of Hitler. Great animation, by the way. The &quot;Creating Being Pretty&quot; video is really interesting. Guys, if you want to know about the masks or the big female robot at the end, watch &quot;Creating Being Pretty&quot;.

Comment: Okay is it me or that I think this is very scary and disrespectful and mean because I have lots of issues I would get thrown in the pit and die this is VERY disrespectful to a lot of ppl me and my dad would die my friends would die my loved ones if they were alive would DIE. This was horrifying to watch I‚Äôm depressed I have anger issues I‚Äôm trying to lose weight. So this is a low rating from me bye.

Comment: So basically this means, if you&#39;re not perfect, then you&#39;re ugly, and ugly is another way of saying &#39;nonperfect&#39;. And if you think about it, it actually makes sense. You don&#39;t see fat kids , or kids with metal/physical disabilities have friends, or seem included and welcomed, because most people are bitches and they only care about the people who are perfect. It&#39;s just showing that this is the sad reality put into a different way.

Comment: Excellent animation, inspired visual style, and the atmosphere is engaging. The moral behind it is deluded and preachy though... Why is the dystopian genre the playground for half baked psychology fueled by ignorance? Why can&#39;t we get another Dishonored or Blank? Why is it always &quot;America becomes teh Nazi/middle east!&quot; Of the literally infinite aspects of our social structure&#39;s flaws how is it that the racists always come out on top?

-----------------
Author: Whos Artorias
Comment: So, I understand how this is wrong and why everyone agrees. But I&#39;m genuinely asking, could this be right/acceptable/good/ect? Some traits are generally accepted to be bad. Could&#39;nt separating them be a solution? I will also add that I am disabled and depressed, among other stuff I&#39;m sure.. so I would be no exception. But if I could make the world better by my abscense, I might be willing to make that sacrifice. Not necessarily my life, but I could live with being separated from the beautiful, rich, ect.<br><br>I would like to know if anyone might agree and why, but also why this wouldnt work in some form. Is equality truly the answer? Are there any faults with that? I feel its important to explore both sides of an idea. you can hate me for asking this, but I&#39;m simply curious. I mean no offense or harm.

Comment: I‚Äôm actually writing a book that is kinda similar to this concept. Mostly the ‚Äúmasks‚Äù thing, but other then that my story is pretty different. BUT, I started writing my story, found this video a few years ago after I started writing and didn‚Äôt think much of it. Now, I‚Äôm worried that if I ever do publish the story I‚Äôm working on, will I get hate and stuff for ‚Äòcopying‚Äô this idea? I never even knew this video existed while I was making the concept and I don‚Äôt think my story is THAT similar, but... who knows. I could copyrighted? I‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt really know that much about publishing, but would I not be able to put out that  story because of it being similar to this video?

And,  She&#39;s really nice, sweet, caring, and loving. But, many guys judge her by her looks. She really like this guy, so she asked him out. he told her </b><b><del>he don&#39;t like dating</del></b><b> , than the next day. Another girl asked him out, he said &quot;yes&quot; like literally so fast. She became sad, because every guy had rejected her. She told me, no guy wants to be with an ugly girl. And, I also have this gay friend, he likes guys, and most guys feel awkward around. Whenever he go near them, they fucking move away. Like tf. Some girls are like called him names and stuff. Than, he told on the teacher, but let&#39;s just say, the teacher &quot;wasn&#39;t supportive towards or like gay people&quot;, he told them to &quot;stop&quot; and no shit after that. They keep continuing. I got mad, and I put a dick on their throat. They were beefin with me. I ate all of dem asses. I got suspended for 4 weeks, and they got suspended for &quot;2 weeks&quot; I was like HOW T F IS THIS FAIR! They said &quot;you started the fight first&quot; I&#39;m like, hell naw nigga.  smhh. Life is just depressing. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re gay, ugly, far or whatever. Just be yourself. Those niggas and bitches will one day eat their own asses C:</b>

Comment: This is what happens when you don&#39;t accept people for who they really are. People are different. They have different preferences, and that&#39;s what makes us humans. This video portrays a society where different preferences are not accepted. And the worst part is that this society is very similar to our society, the society we live in today. The only difference is that it&#39;s more extreme. Many people today bully and judge others because of race, religion, sexual orientation, looks, different abilities and different preferences. They think they have the right to do so, because they justify themselves saying that they are just voicing their opinions. However, what they don&#39;t know is that judging, insulting, or trying to force someone give up their personal preferences is not the same as voicing an opinion. They are so ignorant, and yet they don&#39;t accept that and still think they are right. It&#39;s sad actually.

Comment: It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs creepy, and somewhat true, what I mean is that some people don‚Äôt accept the way people are and it explains what that means in this video, like excluded for being gay, fat, deaf, blind, having a disability, etc. and the people who were excluded died because they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and this just makes me cry because.... of the way they treat the others who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and they are basically saying that they only take normal people, and perfect people with normal lives, and nobody isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù take me for example, I have a language prosessing  problem and I‚Äôm a little chubby, and if the world was like that... then I would be dead like the others... I like the film a lot and it‚Äôs overall a great film

Then the robots are sent to the actual person‚Äôs original destination . So my guess is.. The kid‚Äôs real parents at the beginning are decomposed,rotting,filthy  dead bodies...<br><br><br>And that‚Äôs pretty chilling

Comment: I have a question! So I understand the point of this and the concept is truly sad and disheartening. And you did an excellent job with the animation. But what are the rules. Gay, Fat, Disrespectful, Depressed. Were shown. So someone like me who has anxiety would I be considered &quot;Ugly&quot; in this world? Or someone who was born with diabetes would they be &quot;ugly&quot; in this world. Or even someone with cancer or facial disability? I&#39;m just kinda confused on the rules if someone can explain ferther that would be a large help thanks! Also to add I think i&#39;m gonna subscribe to this channel because you executed this so perfectly. And everything was so well put together! Good luck in the future! I&#39;m excited to see the future of your channel!

Comment: it looks like it represents society as a whole in job life and responsibilities. People who have these things tend to make themselves look good rather than feel good, so that they can survive and be able to take care of others. But little do they know, they are taking it too far. They neglect themselves and their mental health, caring about others wants and needs more than theirs. Masking yourself isn&#39;t going to get them nowhere. Instead they&#39;re adding salt to the wound. <br><br>Unlike the adults, the children know how to feel pretty, than look pretty which is important to their mental health.

Well, I don&#39;t go to school &#39;cuz I&#39;m depressed so I must be ugly but the media can go shove that info up their ass. I may be &#39;ugly&#39; but I&#39;m still alive and this makes me want to live, tbh. This makes me want to live the way I want to. Fuck society. Fuck the government. I AM MY OWN GOD DAMN PERSON SO DON&#39;T YOU DARE TRY AND TAKE THAY FROM ME!!!

Even if you&#39;re born &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;pretty&quot;, one day, you&#39;ll be thrown into the pit like the rest of the &quot;uglies&quot;.

Comment: This is disturbing for a reason and it is also very touching. The background music really sets your emotions in, and I feel sadden towards the way society these days treat people who are different. From my understanding, this animation film is that we are all different people. Nobody is perfect but society demands ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and look down on the ‚Äúuglies‚Äù or the disabilities and homosexuals people. I believe that when everybody start to open up these heart and minds, and accept and feel compassion for one another, I truly still believe in humanity and yes, peace on earth can happen.

Comment: I take this less as ‚Äúour society depends solely on beauty‚Äù as people throwing their problems away. Everyone who isn‚Äôt ideal or perfect is tossed in a ditch to die. Nobody will take time to nurse the old, cure the diseased, or deal with people different to them. Everyone wears a smiling mask so nobody has to deal with another‚Äôs emotions. (Maybe to hide race?) Everything must be organized, robotic, and perfect without having to deal with those who need help.

Comment: To classify something as pretty or not pretty is a common mistake. Just because you are told you are not pretty where&#39;s the truth in this? Pretty is a adjective. An adjective doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t describe you. What should describe you is your personality. Gay, Divorced, blind, old, deaf, fat, mute and ect.

Comment: I was so confused to why they were saying &#39;stay pretty&#39; to everything. It&#39;s basically saying that if your gay, your ugly. If your divorced, your ugly. If you be yourself, YOUR GOD DAMN UGLY!!!! And if the masks cover the &#39;ugly&#39; people&#39;s faces, why do they cover the &#39;pretty&#39; people&#39;s faces too? I&#39;m so confused....üò´

Comment: This video stood out so much that it made me cry in such a short time it shows that some people don&#39;t accept people as they really are and look past and shove them or bully them into being someone and thing that they are not and that people were made to be just the way they are and you shouldn&#39;t look at their disabilities sexuality or weight that they are the way they are and some people don&#39;t want to believe that and think that all those things matter but they don&#39;t...

Comment: Today being religious and having a nuclear family gets you thrown into the pit. I work full time, my wife cleans the house and makes the food. I was a virgin when I got married, for these things I am often stigmatized against in films like this. And by my peers who knew I was a virgin and have religious beliefs. Today being gay is cool and in, it&#39;s like the emo phase of the 90&#39;s/early 2000. This video has it all backwards, straight nuclear families and older virgins with religious beliefs are more often put down.

We are still humans, for God&#39;s sake! Nobody is perfect!

Comment: Most of the comments I&#39;ve read are about that &quot;Gay&quot; thing and maybe other stuffs...there are people who talks bad about them and some are good...well, it&#39;s not like gay people take drugs or kill people (Or maybe it depends? Even if they did...I know those people that are NOT GAY also did the same lol) Not all....<br>I don&#39;t dislike gays tho<br><br>And about the &quot;Old&quot; one.....everyone gets old someday so that&#39;s mean they&#39;ll all go into that pit someday too so it&#39;s no use to be what they call &quot;pretty&quot;...or maybe the word &quot;old&quot; refers to something else? idk lol<br><br>Just my opinion.. (sorry if my english is not good)<br>And according to this video, I am one of the ugly people then....I know I&#39;m not perfect like those &quot;pretty&quot; one :)

I don&#39;t know where you got this twisted idea from, but you made it perfectly. It shows how society casts out people who are different, or &quot;ugly&quot;, so that pretty people can stay pretty and not be &quot;dirtied&quot; by ugly people.

Comment: In all honesty if something like this was real in a specific location, said location might actually be fully &quot;pretty&quot;, meaning everyone gets a mom and a dad, no one gets a divorced/gay parent(s). Everyone has a job and does what&#39;s right, all the unfit members of society aren&#39;t present. It&#39;s obviously violent to throw them into a pit, but at least putting them elsewhere would provide the others with an actually perfect society. Even if people who aren&#39;t even very attractive get casted out, that place would house the most attractive people in the world. Natural selection on another level

It&#39;s disgusting. I also love how the video is in black and white, whereas the blood is red. It really sets the mood. Good job! And remember, STEH PRETEH. üòÇ

Comment: So, the meaning of this short-film is simply <b>labels.</b><br>Yes, the masks cover everyone&#39;s faces, but they put labels on them, and that what they&#39;re defined by. That&#39;s what anyone cares about in autodale and this society. It&#39;s sad. It&#39;s cruel. It&#39;s not human.<br>Plus, there&#39;s not even anyone to compare themselves to. Nobody can know if they&#39;re ugly if they don&#39;t know if anyone else <b>is</b> ugly. They don&#39;t want anyone or themselves to point out they aren&#39;t pretty.

Comment: This is how society is today. No one really see&#39;s this though. Since I have anxiety and depression I get thrown in the pit. Since I&#39;m a hideous creature I get thrown in the pit. This world today only cares if you&#39;ve done something big. If you don&#39;t wear makeup you&#39;re a screwup. No one really see&#39;s how the world is now. I always have these conversations with people but so many are still blind. They wear makeup, act perfect, and they&#39;ll be accepted. So many people have told me I&#39;m hideous and I know the truth. The truth is they&#39;re hideous on the inside. Society only cares about looks. But if anyone gets bullied and they&#39;re not accepted by this world like me. Just know you&#39;re more than pretty. You&#39;re beautiful. You don&#39;t belong here because you&#39;re too perfect. If you&#39;re not accepted. Just know...you&#39;re amazing, beautiful, and everyone should be falling for you.<br><br>If you fight wars like me. Just know you&#39;re not alone and you are beautiful...inside and out..

BE YOURSELF people and just don&#39;t care what other people think, if you do that then you will inspire other people to do that too üëå

Comment: When I saw the man who had a mask that said &quot;gay&quot; in the hole I could not be more triggered. Everyone is different and that makes that person special. Pretty and Ugly is a term that gets thrown around to much. Gay lesbian or bi, It doesn&#39;t matter. People should not disrespect someone who is different. Different makes the world diverse. If your weird you are not weird you are unique. If you are &quot;pretty&quot; you are just like everyone else. Because everyone is pretty, charming, and beautiful in their own special way. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully you feel the same way. Thank you &lt;3

That they are outsiders, that they are just nothing to this world, and that they are just monsters and not people! But they aren&#39;t! I&#39;m not! Your not! So don&#39;t feel like you deserve to be thrown in that pit! We are all different and that&#39;s how this world works! If we all acted the same then this world would just be nothing! Please don&#39;t feel like you are nothing because if you were then you wouldn&#39;t be here at all! Please! You are unique and rare! No matter what all those haters say. You are perfect the way you are!

Comment: no one is perfect... its what robots cant understand... they are uniform and &quot;pretty&quot; but people are different. they look different. they act different... they talk different... there are different learning speeds... different strengths and weaknesses... there are fears some unique to a small group some more  common... there are disabilities, there is trauma. there is sadness and impurities... those who are alive are not living. for pretties are not thinking for themselves... pretties arent human anymore. this is our society. those who we deam different or weird are pushed away by us... we judge people... we reject things people and ideas. and we hold others close. those whom we dont like tend to become a focus point for your anger or hate... bullies are born. those whom are young, infants, are pure... they are forgiving... they dont judge... we as adults need to be more like them.. be suportive, careing, friendly people.  accept people the way god created them. embrace people that are not just part of your klick. view the world as the whole picture not just as a puzzel piece. live in someone elses skin.... think about it... there are still good people in this world... the sad thing is.... that we are supprised when we find a good person. be good. kind. love each other. look past disabilities and differences. imperfections... for its not the outside that counts...you can be  beautiful on the inside if you want. everyone has potential to blossom... not everyone takes the steps to do so. this is what our world is coming to has been... we should accept eachother for how we are. dont try to change people. its not like that. just find it in your heart to be a good honest person and you will bring happiness to those who meet you and are around... smile... its contagious. üòÅ

Comment: Uh guys you know people really think this about people and it&#39;s sad because God made us all equal as a family and we need eachother. All the crime that&#39;s going on now shouldn&#39;t really even be here. We&#39;re all related no matter the race, facial looks, gender, color, we&#39;re all the same. So be nice to each other because you&#39;re talking to you&#39;re relative.

Comment: Being removed from a community because you&#39;re different, because you have a different faith than the others, because you&#39;re fatter or slimmer than it&#39;s normal, because you have different tastes in every little thing seems so wrong to me and I always hated that. Thank you for doing this animation, for me this film shows that you don&#39;t have to be pretty based on some standards. And one thing I would like to tell to each one of you is that you don&#39;t have to be all the same to be beautiful. You&#39;re beautiful in your own unique way ‚ô°

Comment: I am pretty sure the message is that in this universe everyone has to follow a certain path, but as we know reality in most countries is not like that. We should follow our own path and shouldn‚Äôt have a mold that creates who we will be. They want the divorced, old, fat, gay, etc. people to be killed so they can have a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù town. In the real world this isn‚Äôt real which is very very good. And everyone should be happy with who they are.

Comment: this seems obviously influenced by radical beliefs of today, striving to perfection doesn&#39;t equal oppression. This film seems to point fingers at those that are born with &quot;privilege&quot; but the truth is that in a natutal setting, those people would be the only to survive, the fittest in survival. But we&#39;re not natural, and that&#39;s the real horror, that we are allowing our humanity to become diluted by ideas of what &quot;should be&quot; or how people &quot;should act&quot;. As long as we&#39;re each striving to our own perfection, we can all be the fittest, but we can&#39;t just blame perfection itself for being natural. Whatever you are, whoever you are; just strive to be the best of it and the fales will get weeded out, because nothing is wrong, nothing is immoral, and our nature will be the only thing to save us.

Comment: This video can have a lot of different interpretations and theories. Heres mine<br><br>The humans believed that a strong computer (AI) as a government was a good idea, and they thought it would have no flaws. <br><br>It seems like the AI was corrupted. And it seemed yo go AWOL. it has its robots killing &quot;ugly&quot; people in the attempt to make a utopian society. <br><br>As seen in the sequel &quot;no monsters&quot; having the dystopian society has created monsters that only the smartest fear. The AI seems to be the monster itself. The &quot;exceptionals&#39; are stripped if everything but thier main vital organs and are plugged into the AI as an attempt to fix the corruption.<br><br>This only made it worse. <br><br>Can we have a part 3??<br><br>Also you dont see the &quot;ugly&quot; people. You only see the label that society has given. <br><br>This shows how judgmental society can be.

Comment: Try reading the &quot;Uglies&quot; series I have heard of online about a civilization that have all children grow up in Ugly Town then when they become adults they go through plastic surgery to become pretty. There are 4 books in the series:<br>1) The Uglies<br>2) The Pretties<br>3) The Extras<br>4) The Specials<br>I heard it is based partly on the Twilight Episode &quot;Number 23 Looks Like Me&quot; A society where all people get a plastic surgery at 17 and have to choose between 8 bodies for each gender. People are vain and calm and drink &quot;Instant Happy&quot; (An actual drink). There is some air of 1950s US culture the show was written during that era.

Comment: I found the video frightening but very true, because it was about how we look at the outer appearance of people and judge or put a label on them without really getting to know them well enough to see how pretty they really are. I thought so anyway

Comment: ok let me just say, I&#39;m gay, fat, distorted, and many other things that go into the pit, but I&#39;m so proud of being &quot;different&quot; then to be &quot;pretty&quot;. Also is nobody else worried that this could happen in 20 years or so. Also if you are gay I have something to say... STAY GAY AND PROUD!

You may say someone is pretty because that‚Äôs your standards and that‚Äôs ok. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are disabled, blind, deaf, gay, or any possible minority, you are still beautiful. <br><br>I know this comment is long and thank you for reading this far.

Comment: When I saw <b>gay</b> I got totally triggered... ANYway this is basically peeps being judges based on their likes, dislikes, looks, ideas, opinions...its a fucked up version of the real world. When people say &quot;Wow, Samantha is SO ugly.&quot; All that person is doing is killing others with words and these are reasons people commit suicide, because they feel as if their existence is not even needed nor is it wanted. So if anyone even bothered to read my long ass comment, just hear me when i say this: <b>Words only have power IF you choose to give them that power, and if you do choose to do so then your not bothering to fight for all the justice you KNOW that you deserve...</b>

-----------------
Author: Arnold thotticus
Comment: A little theory-<br>(I&#39;m gonna be talking about the new animation so if you haven&#39;t seen that go watch it)<br>(About the other animation) So i think the story at the beginning- the fairy tale- i think the monster represents the truth. When she discovers it, she&#39;s scared, as you would be if you found out what was going on at a young age. So she hides from it, trying to deny the truth until the people trick her into believing everything in Autodale is fine. Someone in another comment said the monster represents her individuality, and the view society has on it but i think that can&#39;t be true, as shown by the mother&#39;s line at the end, &#39;you won&#39;t hide from your monster, will you?&#39; I think the mother is trying to help her child, trying to help her accept the truth rather than run and be afraid. The woman running from the robots later in the video is someone that is an outcast, that knows the truth, and both the robots and the ugly people (i&#39;ll talk more about them in a minute) represent the society not wanting everyone to know how messed up everything is (it shows in the first video that they&#39;re trying to make everyone believe in traditional families and believe that nothing is wrong). Now for the uglies- i think they represent people who are mentally or physically ill, and how society locks and hides those who are ill. It just makes more sense to me. All the labels they put on people are things they deem illnesses in this dystopian world so they lock up the people that make their city look bad, as they used to with many ill people in history.

And then we tell ourselves we are good people. I wonder, how many of those who watch this video will go away and continue to shun those they don&#39;t understand. Probably most of you. This sort of behaviour can, and will, be fatal. Please, be compassionate. We don&#39;t want this video do become factual, do we.

Comment: Very good animation, really did a good job of creeping me out. Also I think this is about our society in a way. People judge others by appearance and only want to be pretty, and all of the &quot;uglies&quot; end up pushed away.

Comment: Does anyone else somewhat see this as Today&#39;s Society? Kids in school bullying those who are different, those who lost something or was born said way, those who chose to be happy in their own way, the ones who want to be human in a world that seems to be run by mindless things who to a survey of the world and set up a goal based off, say, 51% of the population and turns their back on the 49% that are outside of the box who want to be different, be special, be them, but they can&#39;t because mostly everyone is against them and how they think, how they see things, how they look. Isn&#39;t that Today&#39;s Society?

Comment: So basicly the pretty are the people that do the same things as others and aren&#39;t unique.And they go by the rules.The ugliest are people that are unique and <a href="http://different.so/">different.So</a> they kill them because they don&#39;t want them there.And the exceptional,I think that they actually know what&#39;s happening AND are pretty.Some of the exceptionals try to run away.They will sometimes be put into this thing and they turn half human (The exceptionals are in another video like this one)Then part robot.Just watch the other vid.

Comment: So if you behave and follow society&#39;s rule and acceptions for you then your &quot;pretty&quot; but if you go in anyway outsid of the circle like some of the example at the end (old, divorced, fat, ugly, gay) then you won&#39;t be &quot;pretty&quot;.<br>This video really hit me hard. It&#39;s showing that almost no one in society can be perfect. It&#39;s really scary how true this is to life is you could be easily judged and discarded for basic things that people can control once again like the examples at the end (deaf, depressing, crippled, blind, sterile)

Comment: I read comments and I <b>hate</b> it when people call themselves ugly. That is NOT true and don‚Äôt ever say that yourself! Ever! I really hope that you understand that you are NOT alone and you‚Äôre beautiful just the way you are. Don‚Äôt hurt yourself because that‚Äôs not helping you, is it? I understand that you feel like you‚Äôre dying inside and that you need someone to love and want you. Well, obviously there‚Äôs a lot of people that care, especially me. I have felt this way before but once i got out there I knew there was a light inside me. So please don‚Äôt call yourself ‚Äúugly‚Äù or anything for that matter. Just be happy and follow your heart because I KNOW that will make you feel better. I‚Äôm telling you the truth so please listen to me and never call or harm yourself because it‚Äôs not going to make you even better. Even if you‚Äôre having a rough time on life you should know that there‚Äôs someone out there that cares, at least one. Don‚Äôt just wait for that moment to come, get out there and show yourself that you‚Äôre worth it because haters are going to hate. Please don‚Äôt EVER forget that you‚Äôre beautiful just the way you are and you‚Äôre worth more then bullies or even haters (obviously). It really hurts me to see a lot of people in the world hating on theirselves, it really does :(. So please do this for me and for the people that loves you, (trust me, a LOT of people do love you so don‚Äôt be saying no because that wouldn‚Äôt be true.) to ALWAYS love yourself and don‚Äôt EVER call yourself ‚Äúugly‚Äù instead, just call yourself wonderful and amazing because you are! And don‚Äôt EVER harm yourself because that wouldn‚Äôt help anybody. Just get out there and follow your heart and dreams. Now that‚Äôs what you should be doing. You can change your life and change you! And of course, most importantly you change that frown upside down. I love you all with all my heart and I care for you so read what I‚Äôm saying and repeat after me, ‚ÄúI am beautiful just the way I am and I am worth it no matter what.‚Äù Repeat that until you realize that it‚Äôs true! Please be happy and make your life even better then yesterday! I know you can do it.

That&#39;s honestly the saddest one- you put in so many years of service to your dystopian community, until they betray you for something that eventually happens to everyone, assuming you don&#39;t die earlier. This reminds me of the Giver&#39;s community, only they treated it as a celebration.

Comment: This is deep.. It represents today&#39;s society, and what people call &quot;ugly&quot;  like being gay, disabled, fat, etc. And would get rid of them by bullying them and sending death threats. Being &quot;pretty&quot; is what they call skinny, and perfect. Its really deep..

Comment: For those of you that don‚Äôt feel like watching this, long story short, this is basically saying that every minority (ex: gay, retarded, or disfigured) will be immediately killed due to not being ‚Äúpretty‚Äù in the eyes of the majority. I‚Äôm still a little confused about the moral of this animation, I guess it‚Äôs supposed to make me feel bad for something? What it seemed like to me is that anyone with the before mentioned qualifications of being ‚Äúugly‚Äù must be seized. So basically every majority is hitler. Good moral.

Comment: Um, this has been done so much in films, books, etc lately that is honestly getting boring. Let‚Äôs face it, we keep saying that perfection is overrated, but we humans will never stop trying to reach it. Society will always be there. We are all influenced by something/someone.Let‚Äôs get real, even the person who created this film would never date someone society doesn‚Äôt consider ‚Äúpretty.‚Äù Please, just get over it. It annoys me how the film tries to portray a traditional home. If you want to say that we should accept everything and anything , then good for you but don‚Äôt diss what some may call traditional.

Comment: This animation is very Heart-touching, as it talks about how the world can be cruel to you when you do something new, or unwanted. The masks hid their real self, as the &#39;Pretty&#39; family also had the parents wearing their masks. When the people were dumped, they were being abandoned by the whole world around them, like if you do something to displease the world, they&#39;d shun you. Also, the people who were dumped had done something to upset someone, as they had said, Gay, Divorced, Blind, Disfigured, Deaf, Fat and many more. These labels are mostly not their fault, it was the rejecting world around them. If you were one of those people, would you like to be ignored and rejected by many others? I say the lesson for this was to treat others the way you want to be treated, and things will turn up better.

Comment: Here is an explanation to this video:<br><br>In this distopian future society is governed by an AI. Humans thought this would be the solution to a utopia as an AI has no bias and runs entirley by logic, thus making corruption extinct. <i>Or so they thought...</i><br><br>Turns out, computers are <b>too</b> logical. The AI sees people who aren&#39;t &quot;Pretty&quot; as imperfections that need to be eliminated to provide the perfect society (At least in the computer&#39;s view). In order to create a utopia, the AI brainwashes the young into accepting that &quot;uglys&quot; being taken away is good. The AI also controls those robots &quot;removing&quot; the &quot;uglys&quot;.<br><br>Sure,  a utopia was created. But only with the sacrifice of billions and those that are left; brainwashed shells of actual people. That giant woman at the end is the AI controlling this fucked up system.<br><br>This is my interpretation based off of what someone else has said about this video. Yours can be completley different and that&#39;s fine :)

Comment: This is a beautiful yet terrifying animation. It shows the problems in our own world, the scene where we saw the ‚Äúuglies‚Äù was shocking but accurate. Even as I read through comments it got worse, is our world so bad that we are obligated to look at others that are different and judge them? And most people only focused on the gays. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs a bad thing, and I‚Äôm glad people accept gays into our world, but their were more people down in that pit, more people that we ignore. Just because someone screams louder doesn‚Äôt mean they need the most help. I would also like to say, respect others opinions, YouTube didn‚Äôt add a comment section and say ‚Äúnow watch it burn‚Äù think about what you‚Äôre typing, you can easily censor yourself online. It‚Äôs just that you have to think and try to do so.

Comment: This film is very moving and teaches people to be nicer to the &quot;different&quot; because as soon as i saw the word &quot;Gay&quot; on one of the peoples faces or heads my face went completely blank there is no emotion because gay is just a title people are so mean to people who are gay or disabled or even just deaf or blind no ones perfect no one can perfect and I think this should be shown to those who are mean or dislike people who are different there are to many words out there that mean so many different thing that are mean and i think those should be gone or everyone forget about those very mean words.

Comment: You know what, the reason people are so judgmental and rude is because people make such a big deal about this. It&#39;s like bullying, if you ignore the bully eventually they will stop. If you let them show their bothering you they&#39;ll keep bullying. So In other words quit complaining about how mean people are and grow up and not give a shit because you are your own beautiful different person and you should strive to be that person.

Comment: I wonder if the beast at the end was actually the last human on earth being bred with her own offspring to produce more humans so its not just robots vontroling everything. But theres lots of rejects that must be thrown away. The ones who are alive are partially ugly but need to perceive that they are pretty. Thus needing masks. The kids were just the rarest of rare people who dont need masks. Plus i do have another theory that robots dress as humans and they take the rejects place so no one thinks otherwise. Thus needing the masks and gloves

Comment: The ironic thing is: &#39;ugly&#39; people are not bad people. The children are allowed to do wrong; im almost sure its about the same for aldults. Even with flaws that are sure to destroy a society such as this with no discipline, society says &quot;You&#39;re still pretty.&quot; That stuff&#39;s intentional.<br>Yet, we look upon unintentional stuff (like being gay, old, sometimes fat), we see that as ugly. I dunno, just wanted to point this out.

Comment: Why does this remind me of the giver?

Author: Otaku
Comment: Before I read the comments I‚Äôm going to take my interpretation of what I saw. At first I was very lost. Why are they being being called ugly and pretty if everyone is wearing a mask? Also why are the children the only ones not wearing a mask. I believe that the children are a representation of innocence, as the television said ‚Äúyou laugh and play‚Äù. Of course there are mean kids which is why I believe they had one of the kids wearing a mask. In general though most kids don‚Äôt see ugly or pretty they just see another human being. When we become adults especially through electronics as I believe it was symbolized through the use of machines at the end of the short story, we often times just see ugly and pretty. How many times do people swipe right or left on tinder solely based on a persons outward appearance or obvious shortcomings and thus disregarded. I also believe that the large female looking robot in which all the robots were standing around symbolized the ‚Äúmother‚Äù or root of everything aka technology.

Comment: in todays society, i wouldn&#39;t say that all people with dissabilities or different sexual orientations are being fucked over, at least in most of western culture. at this point it is the &quot;normal&quot; (for lack of a better word) people who are starting to be discriminated. i am not saying this as the typical white male that believes that women belong in the kitchen and black people belong in the plantations (i find people who think that to belong in an era where people thought that foreigners are evil and that eating pork is a sin). i am speaking as someone that values to speak freely more than anything. and what i am saying is what i feel. please respect that, since i respect your right as well. remember what voltair said

Comment: This has a deeper meaning than what it is shown. It shows a world of people having &quot;Lables.&quot; In this case, these &quot;lables&quot; affect you and anyone can be called something, and be known for it and then looked down on. For example, a mother could be walking her son and see a guy in the woods peeing and the son says &quot;Look at him!&quot; The mother could take a picture, give it to police, and the man would be labled a &quot;Sex Offender&quot; when the guy could have just really had to pee from a long day, and went out to go pee where he thought it was private and then a kid sees him. Reality is filled with this, and it is a terrible thing and it should be put to an end, and that is what this animation is showing us.<br><br>If you read the whole thing, thank you.

Should probably develop your idea a bit more before making something like this.

Comment: I think the message is that the pretty and handsome people hide behind. Well... A mask and don&#39;t show their true feelings and people that aren&#39;t pretty and have problems feel pity for themselves because they aren&#39;t like them they feel like they&#39;re falling through a pit

Comment: Straight to the point isn&#39;t it. It sucks that in this world if you don&#39;t look like or act like the norm, you are a problem. But your a problem from things you can&#39;t control, blindness, illness, color, attractiveness, background, being sterile, deafness, growing and losing youth. Its like telling everyone &quot;being born is a problem if you are not at criteria.&quot; and it is upsetting.

Comment: The interesting thing is that &#39;ugly&#39; encompasses a variety of things that this society deems undesirable. It&#39;s not only about looks, it&#39;s also about a very strict moral code. In this world if you&#39;re non conformist,  you&#39;re eliminated. The people who survive in this dystopia are mere copies of themselves. They live according to the strict values of a totalitarian state, being homogenious in a way that they probably wouldn&#39;t even need masks anymore. Yet a possible trace of individuality might still be hidden behind them and can&#39;t be demonstrated to wider society. <br><br>That the film specifically mentions gays, disalbled, sterile and divorced people as undesirable fits into our current political narratives. If you are about LGBT rights this might be your very specific dystopia, since politically correct culture especially revolves around matters of sexuality. What is interesting to me is that such a world would be equally as terrifying if it adopted our notions of political correctness. If a state with such intrusive powers deems it necessary to purge everyone who meets it&#39;s arbitrary criterion of racism or ableism or sexism just as many, possibly even more people would be killed than in the world of this movie. <br><br>In the end an eternal irony of totalitarian ideologies emerges again: In the name of an ideology that professes to bring about Utopia many more atrocities are commited than in the society it supplanted.

-----------------
Author: Rico Suave
Comment: This is going to sound like a joke, but honestly another type of person who are not considered &quot;pretty&quot; in society standards are those who can&#39;t fulfill someone&#39;s sexual needs... specifically a person with a small penis such as myself. Usually everybody sees us as the example of a pathetic man, and it can be really frustrating. Getting make fun of is something that I learned to deal with, but something that I can&#39;t stand is the fact that it would seem impossible to find someone who can truly love and stay faithful towards me, because it doesn&#39;t matter what I do, if that one &quot;true&quot; love finds someone who is way better at sex then me then everything will be gone. You can proceed to laugh at me or make jokes or anything, but just know that small guys can also be part of the &quot;ugly&quot; ones.

They called me fat. I got sad. They said I was depressing. I got sadder. They said all these things that were caused by my depression and suicidal thoughts. Them saying those things cast me deeper and deeper into depression. It was a vicious cycle. All I need is for someone to say that it will be okay. That&#39;s all I need. And... A friend. I suppose I will need that too. In this thing we call society they say these things and don&#39;t bother to apologize. Only the people who are kind matter. Dont listen to the others. Just the kind ones.

It&#39;s like judging the book from the cover and when you read it...it&#39;s good book...life really I care about looks or anything the only thing I care about is personality if they mean or not or if they a bully or not that&#39;s all i care I don&#39;t care about skin colour or anything from this...I hate the fact that most of the people  are either racist , mean , bully , violence<br>I also hate the fact that animals are much smarter than us Atleast they respect others you bullies should be ashamed because I being serious I know most of humans won&#39;t get my comment..So what&#39;s point telling this all ?

And the naked figure at the end? In my mind it shows how we oversexualize people these days. This deserves to be seen by many more. Amazing job to the creators of this film.

Comment: It&#39;s sad because a lot of today&#39;s society kind of expects everyone to be &quot;perfect&quot;, or in this case pretty. It&#39;s sad because for one, I&#39;m not pretty (I never was), I&#39;m socially awkward, miserable, anxious, I&#39;ve been bullied most of my life, I&#39;m still single, etc. Its sad because it&#39;s true. It shouldn&#39;t be that way. I wish everyone could accept one another for who they are, but unfortunately that&#39;s just not how it is. (Edit: Wow, I‚Äôve never gotten this many likes before. Thanks guys) (Edit 2: Thank you so much for all the support guys. I wish you all the best, and hope you all get better soon.)

Comment: This has so much meaning, The &quot;Pretty&quot; were they people that were perfect. Perfectly figered, no disability, all that is &quot;Pretty&quot; too them. But if you had a flaw like be a girl with boys hair cut, being gay or lesbenin, being chubby. This is a representation of Society. We as Society have made rules for boy angel girl. Such as, boy&#39;s can&#39;t cry, and girls have too act feminineand wear dress all the time and girls can&#39;t know how too fight. We are all different be we all judge people. If I we&#39;re in this world I would be considered &quot;Ugly&quot; because I&#39;m a female with a boys hair cut. And this video is sadly some people&#39;s mindset. It&#39;s true he all judge people but none of us are ugly. <br><br><br>If you&#39;ve stock this far too my message. Thank you for reading. Have a nice resat of your day.

Comment: This is so sad...... I was once judged for not having friends. I was attending a teacher&#39;s day concert I wanted to sing. But they Said I wouldn&#39;t win cause I didn&#39;t have any supporters and rolled their eyes I was crushed I wanted to sing so bad it was my dream to be a singer. I changed my school after that. Still unemployed...

Comment: This video represents a lot of things in life actually with all  these people criticizing everyone because of who they love,what they look like,what they act like,their skin,their &quot;beauty&quot; I know that judging someone is what we do sometimes being judgemental I&#39;ve even done it before and its horrible seeing someone ridiculing them...its sad. I want to help people and make them happy an no you can&#39;t please everyone I know, but with everything going on kids (pretty much everyone does) get this image of &quot;perfection&quot; from all these magazines photos of &quot;beautiful&quot; a female or male characterized to be perfect. This short story I feel like should be showed to teens but its kinda dark...and no not just teens everyone has self-confidence problems some times but everyone is..<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uniquely brilliant in their own way and is beautiful smart kind and <del>YOURSELF</del>

Comment: Looks don&#39;t matter and being fat, gay, or ugly is something us humans care so much about that we don&#39;t know who we truly are in the inside. Plus, everyone is so trendy and want to make fun of the good people who have hope other than being pretty or trendy. Everyone was so rude back then, so I hope you read this message and if your a bully, please stop and try to think of other people other than yourself. Just be nice and kind, it just feels like our humanity and peace just became war and looks. Don&#39;t make fun of people if their a nerd or a nice person whos making peace, just think about it...are you creating a war around that person? Are you having them to have an eho around their head whispering, your nothing...your ugly...you will never be good at anything...no one cares about you...or anything like that. No one cares about looks or trends.<br><br>sorry for long comment and making you read so much.<br><br>This is the right thing to do, stop bulling and abusing anyone or anything. Make the world peacful and kind without wars or any harm to anybody. Stay safe and make sure you don&#39;t do any harm as long as self defense is used then that is not hurting anyone on perpose, it&#39;s for yourself to stay safe so just try to read this or you might not get the meaning  for why I&#39;m writing this.<br><br>Also thanks for reading all the way to the end...if you do, then you are probably a peaceful person in humanity also being old or young dosn&#39;t matter age is like what I said about being ugly or pretty.<br><br>Age is what we all will go through someday. We will all grow or if your a person who dosn&#39;t grow or stays in a certain body, then I have no idea what to say.<br><br><br>I think the age problem gave me a nother thing to say.<br>WHO CARES IF YOUR SHORT OR TALL! I have a really big problem about this...why you may ask? Well it&#39;s just that people make fun of people when their really short or really tall. It just gose the same way as being weak or strong. Including weight. Oh man a lot of people care about being strong, skinny, and tall, mostly boys. I mean,I don&#39;t care about gender and all, but some of the people reading this, I don&#39;t care about what you think of me, but don&#39;t say I&#39;m acusing gender because I&#39;m talking about it right now.<br><br>Look, people don&#39;t want to look at a short, skinny, weak kid or any kind of age, because they don&#39;t care enogh at them because they only care about how strong you are or how pretteh you are. A lot of people care about this so much...I&#39;m sick of this kind of behavior of people in humanity that we all live in. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Don&#39;t kill an animal like me!

Comment: Blind, deaf, retarded, disfigured.  You can&#39;t help being any of those things.  They are disabilities, that may hold you back.  There is nothing wrong with your personality, or how you look if you are any of those things.  If you are any of those things, you are not ugly.  You are a person who has a setback.  You deserve the same rights as anyone else.  If you are any of these things, you are not helpless, and I believe in you.  No matter who you are, just be you.  <br><br><br>Also when I say disabilties, don&#39;t take that in a bad way.  Disability might not even be the right word, depending on how it affects you.

Comment: I can understand if you just aren‚Äôt pretty, but everyone can change themselves for the better. People want middle ground and everyone to be equal. When your overweight and you have health problems due to something you caused (not if you were born with it). Then you can only blame yourself. Sorry people but being overweight isn‚Äôt healthy and you know it. Being gay isn‚Äôt bad to sensible and smart people, you can like whoever and whatever you want, love is love(except when it‚Äôs incest or beastiality that‚Äôs just weird man). It‚Äôs not about being pretty..

We just need to be our self because to be honest everyone is pretty

Maybe not as blatant as killing the person off, but there are ways to make yourself &#39;pretty&#39; (doing these things WONT make you perfect or a better person)<br>-diets/starving yourself to get skinny<br>-pills for depression/anxiety<br>-counseling if you&#39;re gay (usually parents send their kids there)<br>-Hearing aides if you&#39;re deaf<br>-doctors if you&#39;re sick<br>-surgery if you&#39;re &#39;ugly&#39; (dood you&#39;re not trust me don&#39;t get surgery to &quot;fix&quot; yourself because it won&#39;t help)<br>-surgery to fix disabilities (I think)<br><br>The list goes on forever.

Comment: No one is pointing this out, so I will. Even though this video is saying how they get rid of the &quot;uglies&quot;, we also do that in society. We point out people who are different and awkward and act a certain way, and we say that they don&#39;t belong. Our society says that we are adapted one second, then the next, we push others out for ourselves, not to help others, not to help them, but because we think that is normal. I promise you that I have, and you have as well. But once we actually realize what we are doing, we could at least try to help. Otherwise, the words you all wrote down mean nothing, and you are basically wasting your time for something you don&#39;t believe in. If you don&#39;t agree, then what is the point?

Comment: That was not as complex as it could have been. Stories should never have the ability to be summed up with just one sentence; we think people who are different are ugly and should die. &quot;That&#39;s relevant to what&#39;s happening now!&quot; Except the world is not black and white, and people who make bad decisions and do bad things do not do so because they are unfeeling robots. The opposite, actually. Humans do terrible things for stupid reasons, because we don&#39;t process information correctly

Comment: I admit, I am only in the fifth grade, so beware! I feel the need to say that being ‚Äúpretty‚Äù is a pressure in our society in my present day. Sometimes, people are willing to change their bodies (plastic surgery, dying hair, etc.) to be ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. Most of the time, people are willing to change their own personalities to be ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. People even starve themselves, to be ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. I know most of these things because my family, I won‚Äôt specify who they are, are doing all of these things and they ended up with depression and anxiety. So if you end up reading this whole thing (hi there), I want you to know, we ARE pretty, don‚Äôt give a <b>**</b> about what other people say. What I‚Äôve learned about social media, is that if you don‚Äôt have Kylie Jenner lips, Kim Kardashian hour glass figure, and also Kylie Jenner ready makeup, you are considered as our society calls, UGLY. Also one more thing I‚Äôve learned from social media (YouTube, instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, etc.), is that if you post a picture/video of yourself without makeup, you‚Äôll get hate (example; ‚ÄúYour ugly.‚Äù etc.), and if you put a picture/video of you with makeup later, you may get some positive comments (example; ‚ÄúYou look so much better with your makeup on!‚Äù),  but then you‚Äôll get hate (example; ‚ÄúI hate girls who wear too much makeup, that‚Äôs just disgusting!‚Äù). If your still reading this, say heyy in the comments of this comment, and my point is, you are beautiful, even if people say your not. Tysm!

Comment: this film speaks half part of the reality and the other half speaks of the creator&#39;s own way of perceiving things, his finishing things up with a touch of his own art, bringing a remarkable way  to the viewers like me to see the part of his perception with fun. his gift has been credited by many viewers already but we cannot truly express our true appreciation towards this gift because it&#39;s more than just being credited it&#39;s by  continuing  to do something to inspire others who are down.

Your flawless the way you are Society thinks make up, plastic surgery, face lift, butt lift anything of those makes you beautiful but it doesn&#39;t your just not yourself.  What you are is what you are your not something you can just put labels on. <br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m not perfect at all I&#39;m just a ugly fat piece of trash but I keep up my self esteem up I&#39;m made fun of because of it.  I have feelings do you want to know how I got fat I&#39;ll tell you. <br><br>My cousin called me fat and ugly she called herself that in her diary and I believed it about myself so I just kept eating thinking the pain would go away. it didn&#39;t I&#39;m fat and ugly and I might not change I&#39;ll just have to live with it. <br>I shouldn&#39;t even be saying such stuff at my age

Comment: Why is this so true. People just judge you for you. They judge you for being gay, lesbian, deaf, blind, ugly and fat. If there&#39;s one flaw in you someone will find that and bully you, make a fool of you or no one will like you. It just annoys me how people don&#39;t think about others. How they don&#39;t realize you know you have one or even hundreds of flaws. People go into depression. Some even become suicidal and they just don&#39;t realize how they broke someone already broken. It makes me sad all of those people who maybe go through the worst experiences to stop people from bullying them. If someone calls you fat, you become anorexic. If someone calls you gay or lesbian, you break up with the love of your life just so others can accept you. If you are deaf or blind, there is absolutely nothing to do but hide yourself away.I just despise bullies. Why do they do it? To get attention? To be cool? It doesn&#39;t work. You just become evil. The person no one wants to talk to. Being a bully is more bad then good. And if it is WHY DO YOU DO IT?! If you know I want to know so please tell me, so I can understand.

Comment: I kind of feel like this is what the world is turning to. Girls have to wear loads of make-up and make fun of other people for probably even looking at a boy, teasing them and saying that they&#39;re crushing. Boys have to play football and answer back to teachers. Both girls and boys have to use Snapchat and Instagram although they&#39;re underage. Girls have to act fake. Boys have to act hot. They judge misfits. They bully them. I, myself, am a misfit and people bully me for wearing trousers and acting &#39;weird&#39; and &#39;creepy&#39; although, in reality, I&#39;m just a lively person. I&#39;ve noticed that all the &#39;modern girls&#39; (as I like to call them) all have long hair. I know someone who has been called transgender just for having short hair. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with any sexuality or preference - I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m bisexual or straight at the moment - just that people seem to be getting dumber and dumber even though the curriculum is getting higher and higher. I absolutely hate it and wish I could run as far away from people as possible. I feel like I&#39;m speaking for depressed people, as I am one myself, but as far as I know, they&#39;re just my thoughts. Sorry for the long opinion and for wasting your time when you could&#39;ve just read the first sentence and knew what I was going to say anyway.

Imperfections, personalities, your appearance, your actions, your past, if any of it hurts you or you&#39;re ashamed of it or feel ugly because of it, you shouldn&#39;t... AND who you are is more than just &quot;pretty&quot;... You&#39;re beautiful!! This was graphic, and luckily, this isn&#39;t real... At least in some places... But, anyway, EVERYONE, no matter your sex, race, origin, personality, appearance, you&#39;re ALL unique and BEAUTIFUL!! &lt;3

Comment: This film&#39;s concept of &quot;Pretty&quot; isn&#39;t physical appearances, but the perfection of your mental and physical state, and the &quot;right&quot; sexuality that their society accepts, apparently. The figures in the film mostly had masks on, stopping us from actually seeing their faces and judging them based on that, so the only thing we can judge them on is the labels that they had in the pit in the last bit of the video. This video really isn&#39;t about beauty, like most people would think. It&#39;s about what society considers to be acceptable and good. So if a person is a straight, mentally stable and physically normal (as in weight), then they&#39;re considered to be &quot;pretty&quot; on the inside, I assume.<br>  I think this video is trying to mock the fact that we exclude others that we consider to be &quot;ugly&quot;, especially from our children, as the two main characters were shown to be kids. Some of us who consider somethings to be ugly and bad, such as being fat or gay, or being mentally ill. Their assumption of ugliness build and build until it becomes a part of our society, which is the big figure with wires feeding into it. The wires are people&#39;s concepts of ugly and the figure is society<br>At least that&#39;&#39;s what I think

Comment: Does anybody notice how the two kids don&#39;t have masks on? <br>They aren&#39;t being judged by society. Not just yet at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Vh_w_Qb1A&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> when people grow older they get more judged and start doubting themselves and trying to be &quot;pretty&quot; because that&#39;s what they were taught to do.

Comment: This is the exact opposite of society nowadays. &quot;Beautiful on the inside&quot; &quot;Size doesn&#39;t matter&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t bully them because they are perfect the way they are&quot;. People who are &quot;Pretteh&quot; as this says, are forgotten and left to rot. &quot;Prettehs&quot; are &quot;Too perfect to be beautiful. Too normal to be beautiful.&quot; &quot;Supa Prettehs (Famous people. Rich people. Powerful people. You know who they are)&quot; are remembered, &quot;Ugles&quot; are remembered, but &quot;Prettehs&quot; are forgotten. (And yes, this is one big <b><i>Pretteh Ugleh</i></b> joke! trying to see how it would do in a serious conversation. Read it out loud! Try it!)

Comment: It&#39;s sad that somehow it seems like we are being controlled by our own inventions. We keep on focusing on what we think is beautiful. It&#39;s sad that we neglect things that are different. We often go for the looks rather than the insides. We are wanting to be equal, literally. It&#39;s scary to see people looking so alike, so perfect. Their own personalities are gone, they are following what they think most people do. We are somehow like robots in a human figure. This is just my opinion hope it helps.

Literally. Think on that.<br><br>It&#39;s also obvious that many cannot understand my point made by my comment. It is not worth it to argue with me, watch the animation again and see it from someone else&#39;s perspective. Someone who has been told she&#39;s not &quot;pretty&quot; figuratively and literally because she was simply being herself. Someone who has been told to kill herself because she was being herself.

That‚Äôs why we are all different, so that we can admire the ones around us and realize how beautiful everyone is.

Comment: So first I was like &quot;Oh what a great short movie about how it&#39;s the inside that counts. How we don&#39;t look at their face and think the things they DO are pretty. Not how they look like&quot; and went on with this train of thought, and once the &quot;Uglies&quot; came I just kinda assumed that the &quot;ugly&quot; people that was taken away was criminels, rapists, people who make other people feel unsafe, and does &quot;Ugly&quot; things in contrast to the family life doing &quot;Pretty&quot; things. <br>And then the labels on their masks came up and I just went like........ Oh. Well I didn&#39;t expect this. I might have given the first segment way too much credit in the portraying of how people should percive ugly and pretty, and then the end was just like &quot;Lol you have to fit in this robot mold to be pretty&quot; and fucked me up a bit. But it is pretty deep either way. - Should have probably guessed from the &quot;Dystopia&quot; in the title though.... xD

Comment: Unfortunately, this where our world is moving to. Athough our ancestors have all fought for our rights, the notion of what is deemed as perfect still exists and people suffer from it. Whether it be a person&#39;s looks, race/culture or beliefs, we should love a person for who they are instead of judging them for what they are not. Splendid work to the creators for a wonderful piece! Although short, it spoke volumes and showed your talents. Great job!

Comment: Notice how the video was only in black and white. Because society used to be black and white. Used to be. This isn‚Äôt deep it isn‚Äôt sad it isn‚Äôt meaningful, at least not now. There were struggles earlier but some have been resolved. Blind and deaf people don‚Äôt have many social issues now and a lot of tolerance has been taken towards gay people. I just think everyone should stop being like ‚Äúoh this is so true nowadays with all of this hate‚Äù just think of what it was like for generations before. Our society isn‚Äôt completely broken, it‚Äôs better now.

Comment: At first i thought that what he meant by ugly is bad people, but when i saw the people thrown in the trash just because their gay, blind and other. That made me so mad. When people judges someone its the same thing as telling them that they should die even thought they might be the nicest person.  Not to be racist or anything but its the same thing as telling black people to die just because they&#39;re black. Wouldn&#39;t that be unfair if that was you in that position.<br><br>Sorry if this comment is kind of mean

Comment: So wait, alien created/controlled  robots decided to enforce a shallow standard of acceptability for humans,  who they reign over as overlords? What does the evil alien queen/robots get out this? What is their motivation? Is it some sort of genetic experiment where they pick breeding mates to see what the result will be? And why do the people actually go along with this? They don&#39;t even resist and it&#39;s gotta take more than   some weird children&#39;s psa brainwashing to get them to ignore the clearly prevalent robot on human violence happening on every street based on the number of bodies. Why do the robots make  all the people wear masks? Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to find the ugly people if no one wore masks? Then you&#39;d be able to see them right away! With so many killer robots roaming the streets it&#39;s hard to imagine how an ugly person could even make it to adulthood in the first place. I think you were too busy trying to be deep and failed to see the depth of some of these plot holes.

Comment: It&#39;s quite sad because this is actually how most people think, they separate the &#39;ugly&#39; from the &#39;pretty&#39;. People who are called ugly are beautiful, though they don&#39;t know it thus being thrown into a pit of depression, like what happened to the &#39;ugly&#39; people in this video. But actually no one&#39;s pretty because everyone is the same so there&#39;s no &#39;ugly&#39; people to compare it to. Also the one&#39;s who have mental issues or are gay/bi/lesbian are NOT disgusting! They&#39;re unique! Hopefully, this comment gets to some people and if it doesn&#39;t, well, I&#39;ve tried my best...

But one thing I can&#39;t understand is that y r they wearing masks and some aren&#39;t? all of the adults wear masks, but the kids don&#39;t. But then I saw one kid wearing a mask. How come?

Comment: This animation shows how fucked up society is, epically kids. I&#39;ve been bullied well- someone tried to bully me but I didn&#39;t let that happened. Never let anyone bully you. Beat they ass if you have to or please tell someone. A kid at school told me I stink (it was a boy) I asked my friend did I stink and random people I don&#39;t know and they said I didn&#39;t. I even smelled myself. Kids these days don&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying. They think it&#39;s a joke when it really turns out to be serious. A lot of people die from bullying. You might think it&#39;s a joke but it&#39;s really not. Don&#39;t be scared to stand up for your self (violence isn&#39;t the answer but only when someone hits you first) it&#39;s common sense.

Comment: This was an amazing and deep video. This just shows the way our society has become. Our society is so focused on being thin, staying pretty, having the most followers on Instagram, being popular, and that you have to be the way others see you as. So if you be you, you&#39;re wrong, if you&#39;re not pretty, you&#39;re wrong, if you&#39;re not popular, you&#39;re wrong; and it just hurts to see how bad our society has become, because we have to the way others want us to be, and that&#39;s NOT true. Being yourself is the most amazing thing that you can ever do. Because there is only one you in this world, only one personality like yours, so cherish it. Don&#39;t listen to society who tells us how to act a certain way. You are you, you are beautiful in your own beautiful way, you are special and you are absolutely AMAZING!!!üòÑAnd if y&#39;all need someone to be your friend, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m your friend!!!! Anyone reading this comment got a new friend!üòáMe!!!!üòÑ

Just because some looks differently, thinks, differently, is just is different doesn&#39;t make less human and that doesn&#39;t mean they shouldn&#39;t be treated equally.

Comment: I really like the shorts! But I have some questions: Why were the main two children not wearing masks but their friends were? Why did the woman get a divorce at all in she knew divorced people were labeled as &quot;ugly&quot;? Do all old people get &quot;taken away&quot; at a certain age, or did that person just look old for their age? Why were all of the disabled people adults? If they weren&#39;t allowed in society, wouldn&#39;t they be killed as babies? Or are those all people who became disabled due to events later in life? ANSWERS!!

And the &quot;ugly&quot; people are not so desirable people are they end up feeling horrible inside because they got the bad traits hence why they are dead with blood in their mouth and the robots could be the way society tells us we should be like and tells us what makes u pretty and what makes u ugly and the big robot that is pretty ugly could be how our society thinks and how fucked it is

Comment: I think this says a lot about society. Some people say and think it isn&#39;t right to be gay or that your stupid because of a certain disability, I think these things aren&#39;t fair because people don&#39;t choose to be like this. Nobody is perfect and nobody is the same we all have different genetics like skin and hair color and facial features and we all have different sexual preferences too, people can be gay straight asexual bisexual transgender gender fluid pan sexual and more, all of those things make us who we are and if someone believes their not beautiful and everyone else they&#39;ve met say the same then that&#39;s not true because everyone has they&#39;re own opinions about beauty and someone in the world will always love you no matter what you look like. ~~~

Comment: This excellent! Everything is amazing and captures dystopia in an artistic way! I feel like people who see this are like &quot;Goodness, it&#39;s awful! What a cruel world!&quot; Well, that&#39;s dystopia. It&#39;s meant to question and even be a little concerned in advancing society. Of course, we may have problems of this day involving these things. It&#39;s an interesting concept and a lot of thought is well put in it! I&#39;m learning about dystopia in my classroom and I have to say it&#39;s one of my favorite subjects! Wonderful animation and theme!

Comment: this just depicts some people way too correctly, no one can help the way they were born so don&#39;t treat them like they did something wrong because they didn&#39;t, if you don&#39;t like the way they are just leave because everyone is pretty but if you don&#39;t like people the way they are you are not being pretty because you can change the way you feel but they cant and they should be ok with that and you are the ONLY ONE stopping that and that is not fair and that is NOT PRETTY! YOU are one of the main causes of suicide depression of course there are other causes but if you except people as they are there will be less suicide and depression so except people as they are because you  want to be excepted also so act pretty and except people and as the 11 year old writing this if I can except people as they are then I know you can because I have friends who are lgbtq+  or have disabilities and that is ok because they are some of the most wonderful friend I have and any one would be lucky to know them and you cant be friends with people with disorders or people who are lgbtq+ if you are against that and you cant be friends who support it either so just please except them because they are just like you, they just want to fit in so let them and don&#39;t be a bully and don be mean or rude to people who are different because they have a lot to offer and you are just missing out so except people, be pretty.

Comment: This is so sad man and true.  my teacher in 1st grade gave us name tags and put what we had wrong with us, if we had none then she would put nothing in the slot on the bottom. I had a friend, i will call her Katie. She was the nicest girl i had met but she liked other girls anf that was put on the tag. She was made fun of and laughed at. I pushed her up and supported her, but sooner or later she killed her self by drinking bleach in highschool. Found dead in her room, she left a note on her bed. I never got to read it because they burned it with her body. This reminds me of her.

Comment: I think i might make an animation BASED off this with your permission. Instead of the PSA and with the mask no smiles so everyone looks the exact same (except hair and body obviously) however there are uglies which makes people think. that is at least how i would have done it but still amazing

-----------------
Author: I don't know yet
Comment: I&#39;d like to explain what I think the meaning is behind it.<br><br>In this world, it is socially incorrect to have problems based around sexual preference, mental stability, current job status, physical appearance, etc.<br><br>The machine that runs Autodale (I believe it was given the name &quot;The Matriarch&quot; in the video &quot;Creating my Dystopia&quot;) considers these problems social statuses and labels the &quot;Uglies&quot; with tags on their masks, letting everyone know of their &quot;problems&quot; which make them &quot;Uglies&quot; and allowing the &quot;Pretty&quot; citizens of Autodale to mock the &quot;Uglies&quot; until they are thrown into the body dumps and left to die.<br> <br>I&#39;d compare it to the Newgrounds short &quot;Smile,&quot; being forced your entire life to act like someone you&#39;re not, putting on a facade, or mask, to avoid execution.<br><br>If you are unable to hide these problems that make you an &quot;Ugly,&quot; well...<br><br><br>...good luck getting away alive.<br><br>If you were hiding your &quot;ugliness&quot; from your coworkers, friends, and family, but made a slip up, then don&#39;t expect them to protect you.<br><br>Instead, they will shun you for lying to them, repeatedly chanting the words, &quot;You are Ugly! You are Ugly! You are Ugly!&quot; as the robots drag you away and toss you into the body dump.

-----------------
Author: ANNA chan
Comment: I don&#39;t think this is reffering to how the real world is but it actually refers to the media that targets children. Most children cartoons and TV shows don&#39;t show gay or fat people as normal or standard so called &quot;pretty&quot;. That needs to change. Children should be able to understand and accept all the lovely people around them.

Comment: For those who think that real life society is like this: do we KILL those who have these large common faults such as obesity, &#39;ugliness,&#39; divorced etc? Shunning someone because of a bad thing, or an &#39;ugliness,&#39; that they do is logical and in human nature. Didn&#39;t anyone tell you to &quot;stay away from bad people.&quot; I wonder how people would react differently if all the labels were &quot;homophobic,&quot; &quot;racist,&quot; &quot;bigot,&quot; &quot;intolerant,&quot; and things like that.<br><br>Also I wonder what the opposite of this ultra-morally restrictive government would be. Chaos like a jungle? Perhaps each following Overruling person of government being incredibly different from the last causing slowness and outright distrust towards the government.

Comment: In a way, this is so powerful. It doesn&#39;t just show a dystopian universe, but it shows how our society can be. Judgmental and obsessed with being perfect and &quot;pretty.&quot; But really, what DOES pretty mean? It&#39;s just a standard set in our minds that actually doesn&#39;t mean anything, when you think about it.
-----------------
Author: Shane Siford
Comment: This doesn&#39;t really depict society at all nowadays. We are pretty much accepting of anyone and don&#39;t really care if you&#39;re gay, deaf, crippled, trans, etc. People just don&#39;t really care anymore.

Comment: This is very true about our society though, we&#39;re all wearing masks that have happy faces so nobody knows what&#39;s inside, what we think about ourselves, and what we think is true, but it&#39;s not. Just to everyone out there: if anyone says something like &quot;you&#39;re ugly, and fat, and stupid!&quot; Just don&#39;t listen to them, you are you, and you won&#39;t be labeled like what our society does to people. And don&#39;t label yourself, either.

Comment: Wait... do some people think this is what our society is like? No... just, no. In this world, they are brainwashed into believing you must be perfect, or &#39;pretty.&#39; Anyone who isn&#39;t &#39;pretty&#39; will be taken away. In our society, we accept people different from us (except for some homophobic, racist, and sexist people out there. The majority is accepting, though) and help those who are disabled. Don&#39;t try to be a special snowflake who can judge themselves, because it doesn&#39;t work. All you&#39;re doing is making people feel bad for themselves. This short film is not an accurate representation of our society.

Comment: I really don&#39;t think this is going to happen. There&#39;s too many really good people in this world to let this happen. Yes, some people in this world are bad, but they can change. So no, I don&#39;t think everyone is going to be over obsessed with technology, and I don&#39;t think everyone is going to accept only people of their expectations. <b>So. Many. Good. People.</b>

Comment: The reason this is so scary for me is because the world is like that in real life everyone is judged by what they look like and what they do those who are &quot;ugly&quot; are doubted and thrown aside just because of their personality. I myself is &quot;ugly&quot; Im colorblind and gay but you just can&#39;t let the bad parts of you shape who you are nothing about you is bad so really if you dont let people judge you. You Are Pretty

Comment: I&#39;m seeing some people in the comments saying this video is an accurate portrayal of how western culture is evolving are ignorant or misguided, to say the very least. Our current American generation is more tolerant of race, mental or physical sickness/disfigurement, body shape, gender, etc. than any other before it. Comparing a fictional dystopian society like the one in this video to America in 2017 and its years to come makes absolutely no sense.<br>(Note: What I just said may not apply to other worldly cultures, such as the Middle East, in which culture there has made it acceptable to literally kill someone in the street for reasons like, &quot;She wasn&#39;t wearing her hijab the right way,&quot; or, &quot;He was a homosexual.&quot; There are cultures that are this aggressive, but the United States of America certainly isn&#39;t one of them.)

Comment: people are not born judgemental.<br><br>They are so surrounded by themselves that their judgement doesn&#39;t have standards. They are ignorant.<br><br>And society, urges a standard. We put that standard on everyone and everything. We are all different. We weren&#39;t born equal, but we can still have the right to treating others by seeing all of their qualities. instead of being ignorant.

Comment: I personally think the message here is. No one is &quot;pretty&quot;. As humans &quot;pretty&quot; is subjective like most things and there&#39;s no mold for it. Now suddenly robots define pretty to one boxed thing and thus we all end up in the pits someday.

But this amazing...Like kinda feel like this is  society&#39;s  in the real word.. BC what I get from experience and everything that I&#39;ve happens in the word I feel like some people are afraid of different . like a gay person, soecity don&#39;t understand it so bring them down or there just afraid. Like I&#39;m a very spiritsal person, I didn&#39;t have friends growing up so I played in the Forrest with animals. When I stared school I guess people didn&#39;t like me BC I was so ..different..just remember that different can be good. We shouldn&#39;t alienated people witch is not straight or what not!

Even if you aren&#39;t any of those things, you can still be unique and happy and supportive, and I think most people are.

Comment: To be honest, I thought this was going to be something scary which is why I tried avoiding even tho YouTube keeps recommending it nonstop. Saw someone on Google+ reshared this and it made them uncomfortable which kinda make me still don&#39;t want to watch this but more curious to watch it. Saw the &quot;making of&quot; was recommended to me (nonstop too) so I decided to watch it. It was not creepy at all and I like the message. I don&#39;t fully understand what the message is but I think I know what its trying to send.<br><br>I read the comments and I&#39;m kinda confuse why I&#39;m not scared like a lot of people here.

Comment: This is really sad, but really true at the same time. <br><br>You see, I&#39;m not the skinniest stick in the tree, but I&#39;m still healthy. I always get told I&#39;m ugly and fat. I just laugh it off as if it&#39;s a joke, since I&#39;m kinda known as &quot;the chick thats funny and roasted *insert bitch here*.&quot;. But in all honesty, it really fucking hurts.  I don&#39;t have depression, but from my view, I&#39;m pretty suicidal. Now, I&#39;m not look for attention, I&#39;m not going to kill myself, I&#39;m fine. Just everytime someone says I&#39;m pretty (it rarely happens, and i know their lying) I just feel sad. it doesn&#39;t make me happy, it just makes me feel worse, I know their lying. <br><br>Ofcourse I&#39;d get the &quot;just lose weight, then you&#39;ll be pretty.&quot; No, I&#39;m ugly, and that&#39;s just life. Some people are going to be fat, some are going to be skinny. Some are going to be pretty, some are going to be ugly. Thats just how the world works, and it sucks.<br> <br>The only time when someone was serious about me looking good was when I wore SOO MUCH MAKEUP. I hate makeup. <br><br>My mum always tells me shit like &quot;go and wear something else, you don&#39;t look good.&quot; No shit. It&#39;s always formal shit that does it. The one time I felt decent wearing something formal, was when I was wearing a tuxedo. I felt good in it, it covered up what I want covered, and did the job. But I couldn&#39;t do that at my year 6 formal. A female wearing a tuxedo is not socially acceptable. It didn&#39;t help that there was a rumour that i was transgender. Because not only am I ugly, but my voice is too. <br><br>I got called &quot;man voice&quot; and all that shit, it&#39;s not my fault. I&#39;ve had this voice since I was little, I cant help it.<br><br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve given up with this, cya.

Author: HeyPeeps ImLizzie
Comment: Just curious to know everyone&#39;s interpretation of this, but what do the masks mean? And why aren&#39;t the children wearing them? Is it saying that we&#39;re all wearing masks as we get older, but some people&#39;s &quot;flaws&quot; are harder to hide than others?

Comment: A pretty society
-----------------
Author: london
Comment: Gorgeous work! Honestly, I think this depicts out modern day society in a way. Of course the problems have gotten better, but there are still problems such as these. For me it seems that this short film tells about how if you are not &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot;, you aren&#39;t really of value, and sadly, that&#39;s how most of modern every day works. It&#39;s the harsh truth, but &quot;attractive&quot; people are more successful and richer. How everyone who are &quot;ugly&quot; dies, show that if you are not &quot;perfect&quot;, you are not of use. Why do old people become forgotten and irrelevant? Why are people scared to come out as homosexual? Etc. Of course, just because some things are like that doesn&#39;t make you any less of a person. You are beautiful, you are amazing, you are loved and you mean something. The short film has an eerie and creepy vibe to it, telling the watcher that what is happening is not okay, that it&#39;s not how it should be. Again, please don&#39;t think less of yourself, looks are the tiniest part of who you are.

But despite all that, I was still able to make friends. It&#39;s just that whenever I was being targeted, they&#39;re scared to help me. This experience describes my personality today.

Any numb skull who thinks that were all beautiful and equal is somebody who has been brainwashed, were not pretty, were not equal, maybe in oh so perfect California everyone is, but in the real world, nobody is, true acceptance takes effort, it isn&#39;t just givin, it&#39;s earned.

Comment: No such thing as &#39;ugly&#39;. They are labels that people who are plastic (Yes meh is referencing Mean Girls ‚Ä¢3‚Ä¢) or either feel bad about themselves so they put others down to make them selves feel &#39;pretty&#39; and &#39;better or &#39;perfect&#39; that&#39;s what they use that word for. You may think you mayn&#39;t look as good as others, but I personally think that to some others you may look prettier than them in their eyes. Just because you look different, have a disability etc doesn&#39;t mean you are bad or ugly. It means you are unique and special you aren&#39;t a sheep or a thorn along with other thorns or a person who are so obsessed with making themselves look &#39;pretty&#39; that they are pretty much a <a href="http://doll.it/">doll.It</a> means you are 1 in a million, you are a rose among the thorns or you are the sheep who chooses not to follow the herd. Some people are just so cold hearted that they all need a &#39;pretty&#39; and &#39;perfect&#39; society.If you think you are pretty than good, just don&#39;t put others down because you think you&#39;re better.

It&#39;s nothing like this in fact we are more accepting of people who don&#39;t fit into the &quot;norm&quot; nowadays such as gay, autistic, crippled, depressed, etc.  This video was most likely made just to be its own story and nothing else, for you would have to be quite ignorant to think that society is actually like this.<br>Edit:  I&#39;m talking mostly about western society, you don&#39;t need to be pissed at me.

I&#39;m considered ugly because I&#39;m bisexual, I&#39;m not like the Victoria secret girls because I don&#39;t have the curves, and I do have my depressed moments. But hey I&#39;m ugly and proud.

This society have standards if you don&#39;t meet the standards then you are &quot;ugly&quot; and if you meet it that mean you are pretty.<br>The only people we see who don&#39;t have a mask over there face is the 2 kids and most kids.<br>The mask represent you forgetting who you are.<br>You forced yourself to meet the standard because  you are scared.

Comment: I agree with this. To function in society one must play a role in the grandure of things. Having an Ideology (being homosexual, or other choice) can cause war so I could see purgeree happening In the future for a single like minded group to rule. The cold war is similar to this cartoon In a way because of Communism vs Capitalism. If you are &quot;defective&quot; you are thrown away or eliminated per the animation, where as Communism was labeled like cancer- To prevent the spread of Communism America corraled and assisted foriegn countries. Even today America and Russia have there differences and North and south korea are a prime example of what can happen.

But I still don&#39;t Get why all adults here have masks... and don&#39;t Call me stupid for it, please. Did you get it? It&#39;s rude even if you say something bad to a person. It brokes heart, and it can end some lives too... Please don&#39;t do that. Anyone isn&#39;t perfect. Everyone makes mistakes and Everyone are trying to fix them. But sometimes It&#39;s impossible

I feel often discomfort when ppl stare at me, and I know that&#39;s a problem for a lot of persons. I can&#39;t understand why standards, as oppressive as useless, are. We hurt and destroy hearts just because we are not standards. We want to live out of this, but standards are widespread that we&#39;re pushed to take everything too seriously.<br>(Sorry for the crappy english)

Comment: As soon as he started talking about how &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; were pretty as Dad provided and Mom cooked and cleaned and how they lived in white-picket homes, I knew there was a hitch. I knew who the &quot;ugly&quot; people were. I just... didn&#39;t expect so many from so less. It really shows how the numbers pile up. The crippled, blind, old, gay, deaf, retarded- the <i>not normal</i> ones. But if so many people are <i>not normal</i> and so few people are, then what is &quot;normal&quot;? Then those masks... They&#39;re creepy. But they&#39;re not creepy because they are smiling with those weird eyes. They&#39;re creepy because they&#39;re <i>uniform.</i> Men, woman, and children all wear the same mask, with differing hair and built bodies. They&#39;re depicted as wearing the masks. They&#39;re not depicted as being <i>human.</i> Deep as all hell, man. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t pass this video up.

You have a few individuals that might want to go back to life in the 40&#39;s, where only stay at home moms were seen as good woman and being gay could have been a death sentence to some.. and that is the danger but its not how OUR world NOW is at all.<br><br>Its still a beautifully animated piece!

Just because someone is overweight,  does not mean they are fat. Little differences make us who we are, not what makes us ugly. No one is ugly. Come on people, let&#39;s make a change. I am 13 years old, and I believe we can do it.  Together. We are all pretty.

Comment: This is a great story teaching of how people can be to much, how everyone can&#39;t be pretty, this story talks about people being a perfect person, not being affected by any disorder or some kind of thing that explains you, so people who were Ugly were sent to a death, because of the causes of, the people who are to much, to rude, selfish and always told to be the perfect one , and pretty as told in the story, this tells how humanity is causing these horrid events, story&#39;s, and how people shouldn&#39;t, be ugly, just perfect, but there is always something, unperfect to your life! Please criticize or give me other ideas if I&#39;m wrong üòÇ Bye!

Comment: expand whats considered pretty just a little bit, perhaps to include the only slighly ugly (Fats can lose weight), offer an alternative to the not horribly ugly to become pretty (Breeding out unfavorable traits amongst the deaf and blind for example), and keeping the worst of the bunch as is to remind everyone there are still limits (gays mostly), and you&#39;ve got a damn near perfect world.

Just because someone looks or acts different, it&#39;s not automatically bad. People have been saying these things for years, and I know change isn&#39;t immediate, but man is it wanted by many.<br><br>Sorry for the rant I just had to get it out.

Comment: This is a machine&#39;s basic view of society. Gayness doesn&#39;t make sense to it. How will they make the family? How will they replace their parents? It solves this problem by discarding &quot;it&quot;. &quot;It&quot; is ugly. So is depressed. You aren&#39;t fuctioning. You aren&#39;t healthy. That&#39;s not normal, so it&#39;s either fantastic or really ugly. &quot;It&quot; doesn&#39;t help our utopia, so it is ugly. Old is worse. You&#39;re breaking down. Females are now infertile, too, by that age. Uglies must be discarded to help our civilization. Once our perfect society has been made, we can survive again.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>Pretty has been established since the dawn of humanity. It makes us survive. We have been happy if we were pretty, because happiness is the result of survival. So we have been discarding uglies since the dawn of humanity. They wont help us survive, they make it worse.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br> We knew our children would replace us someday. Why have them die? Why be ugly? We wouldn&#39;t survive, so we wouldn&#39;t be happy. Our children shouldn&#39;t be weak men and unmaturely women. It&#39;s not survival. &quot;It&#39;s&quot; ugly. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Our views of pretty and ugly have changed over time. Losing fights was bad, wimping out was a little better, but winning granted the most rewards. Slavery was bad to be and good to own no matter how it was established. Being fat was good then. It meant you ate better and could promise your lifestyle to your companion. But things started evening out. That was bad.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>We tried giving equal rights. We created a free religion country, abolished slavery, and gave equal poltical rights to women (a good move, more and better options that weren&#39;t there before via discrimination). There was jobs evened around for women and men as we got closer to year A.D. 2K. Men could start being the hometaker and women started being the bread winner now and vice versa was still the option. That was alright. But around A.D. 2.026K (2052) Our emotions overpowered our survival. Ugly became more and more acceptable. This was arguably the dumbest move made by humanity. We started dying. Population declining. We had to act fast. Using our quickly advancing technology we built a society to create better, stronger, humans and self using Darwin&#39;s theory because genetic engineering wasn&#39;t usable yet. We built the Matriarch, our supercomputer and manager for the robots until the projects end. Only a few (such as myself) know and are allowed to. Masks were utilized for many reasons. We plan to open again soon. We just need to stay beautiful my friends. For our civilization. For our utopia.

Its telling truth and how people are judged by what they belive, what they look like.<br><br>The ones that stuck out to me the most was the blind and the gay.<br><br><br><br>Now I may or may not get alot of hate for this part but I think being gay is OK. I feel you should love who you love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now being blind i really hate the idea of people judging you over it. Your no diffrent if you blind yet your treated as such. Over all thank you for making this video. It shows us the problems in our world. And how we consider people who are diffrent ugly and horrible. I think we must change that.

Comment: Oh my god, this made me cry.<br><br>Discarding and disregarding the people who are outside of the &quot;standard&quot; mold is a different kind of death, which always leads to a physical death. <br><br>It&#39;s interesting to point out that one of the labels was &quot;Old.&quot; We will all end up there, but instead of accepting it and working to stop the disregard of the old, we try to keep ourselves from becoming old, so we are never cast aside and rejected by society.<br><br>No one should be so rejected from society for the kinds of labels shown here.

Comment: My interpretation of this:<br><br>People follow what is expected of them by society. This leads them to the stereotypical duties of a man or womam. However, in doing so they become the same as everyone else, everyone hides who they really are and conforms to this expectation set by society.<br><br>Meanwhile, those who are &quot;Ugly&quot;, &quot;Fat&quot;, &quot;Gay&quot; ect or those who do not do what is expected of them are discarded by society. Although, they still wear the mask, which to me suggests they are no different from the rest, aside from the names put on them by others. Everyone is equal, but some are mistreated and become &quot;ugly&quot;.<br><br>So the adults become robots, all following their societal expectations, without ever changing.<br><br>Meanwhile, children do not wear a mask. This is a fairly small detail, but to me is the most important thing. It suggests that children are the only ones that are not affected by this. They are happy with themselves and do not need to hide who they are. <br><br>So overall, I think this is about how society teaches us to be like the rest and hide who we truly are, while people who be themselves and stand out are dismissed.<br><br>If anything doesn&#39;t make sense or what I said is wrong lemme know, I&#39;m open to debate aha. Thanks for reading &lt;3

Comment: This touched me. <br>That&#39;s true. People who are &quot;pretty&quot; wants only &quot;pretties&quot;. Everyone else doesen&#39;t matter. Because they&#39;re &quot;ugly&quot;. People are jedged  mostly by how do they look, how many money they have, how old they are. I don&#39;t have good reputation in my school, many people don&#39;t likes me, but I heve few friends.<br>At PE, when someone will fail, It&#39;s &quot;always my fault&quot;. <br>I&#39;ve heard many times &quot;You&#39;re ugly&quot;, &quot; You&#39;re dumb&quot;. I just ignore those people.<br>Being &quot;ugly&quot; is better than being &quot;pretty&quot; in my opinion. Maybe &quot;Uglies&quot; are ugly outside, but often they&#39;re pretty inside.

Comment: This is very true and deep. People just say &quot;Oh they&#39;re fat&quot; &quot; Oh they&#39;re ugly&quot; when those people are actually just the same as everyone else. The people that pick on other people are just attention seeking little brats who think they can get their own way just because they&#39;re mean to someone. This shows that if you kill off all the people who are &quot;fat&quot; &quot;ugly&quot; &quot;depressed&quot; &quot;gay&quot; ect. The world will just be a dull place with no colour and basically people who are considered to be &quot;pretties&quot; get to live out their robotic lives. They&#39;re just the same as everyone else! They&#39;re the same People over and over and over again! Some people can&#39;t help being depressed or being gay or fat or ugly! Some people where born like that! And it is sad to see so many people being bullied or abused because they&#39;re &quot;not good enough&quot; for everybody else! Sorry about the ranting and raving but I think it&#39;s important to let people know that this shows how things aren&#39;t ok in some cases! They are very much like this! People should not be labeled like objects! Because they&#39;re not! They have feelings! I wrote a lot about this short but who cares?! I&#39;m going to leave now! But remember what I said!

Comment: Nobody wants to live in that city. Its so f*cked up.
-----------------
Author: Maria Elizabeth
Comment: Base on my understanding, the mask shows that all people looks the same. Means that we all look pretty. Regardless of our physical traits. No one is down. But it&#39;s just that people in the society keeps dragging us down. We are all the same but judgemental people makes us look different. Just my observation.

Comment: remember nobody is perfect we always have flaws we can never judge without looking at ourselves realize looks will never matter realize its only your personality that matters its only your opinion that matters never let anyone else control wether or not you play with others don&#39;t let them control your talking don&#39;t let the bullies you run into control what you do. often we forget to look on the inside, we forget to search fro what really matters. we forget about the beauty on the inside of people and realize we are not any better then them. we are all equal we all have flaws. we all have skills. we all have things we are not good at. we all have things we are not good at never lie to yourself based on what others think. never judge before you look down at yourself. never judge others on what they look like. judge on only on what YOU think on them you amy give second chances. you amy only give one chance. we shall never know. just remember we shouldn&#39;t have a messed ¬†up life because of what they thought of you nobody deserves that life. sadly a lot of people do however have this life help fix that stand up for people. face your fears for people.say nice things and cheer people on cheer them up! you will never be remembered if your rude if you ever think everybody lower then you realize that nothing in this world is perfect. nothing is worth throwing away because its not pretty nothing deserves special treatments because it pretty. remember this. share this with others.

Comment: It isnt about being pretty it&#39;s about a society who brainwashes its people to conform into being &quot;normal.&quot; They purge the marginalized bc they are &quot;ugly&quot; or do not fit their societal norm. They are so hellbent on keeping the status quo they would kill their own people
-----------------
Author: Sam Gaines
Comment: I&#39;m sure there&#39;s multiple ways to interpret this, but this is what I got out of it.<br><br>In this society, people are labeled as pretty or ugly, and all the ugly ones are killed. However, they all look exactly the same. This shows that in our modern world, people that are retarded mentally or physically, homosexual, bisexual, old, fat, etc. are just like everyone else, yet we view them as bad. <br><br>Btw I&#39;m not an SJW or anything that&#39;s just what I think this video is saying and no matter what side of the political spectrum you&#39;re on you have to agree that not everyone in the world supports people for who they are

Violent things my friend, very violent things indeed. If you encounter an ugly with a painted mask, or weapons report to the authorities before it&#39;s too late these uglies are sneaky hiding in clever places no pretty person would think to look!

Comment: when one of the labels on the mask said &quot;gay&quot; as they were thrown into a pit triggered me a bit because my best friend is gay. but this is so true, society&#39;s point of view is that &quot;ugly&quot; or being &quot;fat&quot; is so taboo when its just reality and we are to scared to face it. not everyone is perfect in every way but we are all perfect in <b>our own way</b>

Comment: So, according to this video, we shld accept everyone for who they are? How about &quot;rapist&quot;, &quot;child molester&quot;, &quot;cereal killer&quot;? Most of these people have a mind that thinks what they are doing isn&#39;t ugly (often brain damage or psychological problems). The real question is: what are the true implications of society never getting rid of any of the ugly? In my humble opinion, there needs to be a correct, absolute, never changing authority deciding the ugly from the pretty. I know who decides it for me, who decides it for you?

Comment: You had to add in gay, not to say in a metaphorical sense it doesn&#39;t apply to the message but it&#39;s assuming that people don&#39;t like gays ( not saying all people love them) and assuming that they are shunned all the time and assuming the viewer needs this lesson on &quot;gays are people too&quot; I find it STUPID that &quot;gay&quot; was on the screen a good second/ second and a half more than a longer word like &quot;divorced&quot; showing that you were brainstorming and gay was one of the tings that you needed to show the public more than lesser known and lesser handled/ recognized issues

Comment: Why do I feel so disgusted sick and disappointed is it because your fat your ugly is it because your gay your ugly or divorced and old. Yes I know some people are ugly inside like people that just kill because they are bored or just wanna feel how it feels to kill  a person but being gay doesn&#39;t mean your ugly it&#39;s mean that you know your self and believe in your self same for everyone one old or young, just married or divorced, new home or homeless we live on this planet earth and this planet is or home so don&#39;t hate but try to help some does not mean give someone money but just simple love saying good morning or night to a stranger or help a person that is lost so if you help people you beautiful inside. beauty does not count outside if your old but  if you hurt or bully people take money from people or even take a person life your ugly inside and outside so don&#39;t hurt people if it will hurt you think if someone bully you how will you feel and that will be your answer.<br><br>Sorry this is my meaning if you think I&#39;m wrong send my a message but don&#39;t say something hurtful to me or anyone <br>Thank you x

Comment: Oddly enough, being a homemaker or breadwinner for your family is considered odd now a days. And &quot;uniqueness&quot; I&#39;d marketed to millions, who all dress exactly the same in an attempt at being different. This would&#39;ve been so much better if instead of the TV saying exactly what we all expected, it encouraged uniqueness because uniqueness sells.

Comment: Wow this is kinda deep, it defiantly paints a picture of what some people in today society are like, they have some issues, disorders, or things like blindness, but are labeled by many people for being different, and just sacrificed into the holes, representing the mainly stereotyped group of people who are just different from everyone else. I have a friend who&#39;s gay but gets bullied so much, that i&#39;m like his body guard, willingly, I feel so bad for him about that (I&#39;m not his interest though). I&#39;m not strong though, so I flip the bird at anyone who bullies him to tell them to screw off.

Comment: I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I still watched it. How many times has this been done before? How many times has there been &quot;propaganda&quot; film parodies utilizing the nuclear family to say &quot;this is TOO perfect!&quot; with the message being &quot;this kind of perfect lifestyle means that being different is bad!&quot;<br><br>Jesus. And people saying this is just like real life? Are y&#39;all in middle school?<br><br>The animation itself was pretty nice, not really any complaints about the quality, but jeez this type of &quot;spooky nuclear family dystopian black and white film where being different is bad&quot; thing is getting so, so old. I remember watching flash videos of stuff similar to this on Newgrounds when I was in elementary school, at this point it&#39;s been overdone.

Comment: This is just mean! Throwing people in a pit to die just because they are deaf, divorced, nerd, or anything else, does not mean they are pretty the way they are. Everyone is pretty, just the way they are. And nobody is in charge of that. You can either be ugly or beautiful, but your still pretty. So if anyone who is ugly who is reading this, here is you message: &quot;Just because you are ugly on the outside, doesn&#39;t mean your not beautiful on the inside. You shouldn&#39;t do anything to change who you are. You should just BE who are, and make friends by BEING who you are. You don&#39;t have to be pretty or popular to have friends, you have to be yourself to have friends. Don&#39;t hide in a shameful place, telling yourself over and over that you have no friends, that no one likes you, you are a take up of space in the world. No, you shouldn&#39;t do that. You should come out of your hiding place, and be who you truly are. You are beautiful inside and out.&quot; And if you are pretty, here is your message: &quot;Don&#39;t be pretty just to make others be your friends. Beauty is in within, inside you, not in makeup. So if you want to have friends, here are the steps you need to take, 1. First, look at yourself in the mirror and say &#39;I am going to get friends just the way I am.&#39; 2. Go out somewhere and do what you usually do to be your self like, fishing, walking, bike riding or others. See! Two easy simple steps. And for extra, walk up to people who are your age, and say &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;how are you&quot;, or &quot;hello&quot; or some sort of sentence. Say what you like to do, what you like and your hobbies. By that, the person who you are talking to, may do, have, or like to do, do something you do in the same way. That way you&#39;ll get friends. But, also to be pretty, or popular, you don&#39;t need friends, just be your self.&quot; Ok, those were my two messages. Bye!

Don&#39;t like that wart on your face? Remove it. It&#39;s that simple. Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves, do something about it instead of lying in you bed during the whole day watching YouTube. <br><br>If you say it is a disability and you have no control over it then you don&#39;t need to worry because people understand you and given enough time, someone will find you beautiful. I will promise you that.

Comment: This is amazing, I&#39;m a sucker for dystopian societies. They&#39;re one of my favourite genres of novel.<br><br>It also so that I&#39;d be considered &quot;ugly&quot; in this world, damn being a lesbian (not really, I&#39;m quite happy with that part of me) and my anxiety.

Comment: anyone else got the feeling of Hitler&#39;s rule in Germany. That robot was Hitler, and preety people were Aryans and the so called ugly were jews, handicaps and so called unfit citizens.<br>SCARY, to think that someday a robot might get hardwired like that and the HITLER&#39;S rule would return

But people keep using other&#39;s weakness to keep themself the advantage of being worthy to be notice. And the different people are being ignored every day.

Comment: You know this is the sad truth and reality we have,made these &quot;rules&quot; that if for example have a different body shape than others we get judged and that is just one of the things society  has made &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;standards&quot; that if your different you don&#39;t deserve to do certain things others can and because of these stupid &quot;rules&quot; people end their lives and people judge you for being you even if they don&#39;t mean to judge you it hurts and people who judge you for things you can&#39;t change like your looks or if they judge you because of your shirt or how you put up your hair people like that really anger me. If you actually took the time to read this long rant thank you if you didn&#39;t and your just reading this thats fine too i just really wanted to,put this out there and im sorry if this didn&#39;t make a lot of sence the way put it.

Comment: This was sad. The comments not the video. It&#39;s an interesting concept but these comments of &quot;wow and we live that&quot; just rub me the wrong way. <br><br>That&#39;s not the world most of us live in. More so if you take the symbolism literally as society discarding the ugly sure there&#39;s some issues that could be discussed but generally, I&#39;d lay money most to all of y&#39;all are blessed enough that you have time to worry about being ugly because survival isn&#39;t a daily struggle. Yeah. Society is always gonna look at some people as less attractive. Always. <br><br>Be ugly and live happily anyway.

Comment: The hard work put into this is amazing honestly and it sends a greater message that in the world we live in we are told to be ourselves but &quot; not like that &quot; the sad reality of being ourselves comes at the price of hate most of the time no one can truly be ourselves we are &quot;forced &quot; by society to act , look and behave a certain way to fit in to feel like we are part of something and those who don&#39;t follow the rules are looked down on as if we are less then anyone else around us ( that&#39;s the message I got from this others may think  different but in the end overall this is beautiful and simply amazing)

Author: Kane Underwood
Comment: When I saw the labels in the holes I laughed. The world should really start doing this. There is too much human garbage in the world. Our planet cannot support such imperfect people. Let&#39;s all really behind this and kill the ugly useless garbage of the world. Let&#39;s start with the children that are severely disabled the ones who will never be productive members of society. Next the sjws then blm and feminazis. Let&#39;s keep going until we rid the world of the ugly worthless people and breed a stronger smarter race that demands that we correct and cleanse the world of uglies. Thank you for your time. <b>gets down off his soap box and heads off to the next shit show to piss off more uglies</b>

Comment: &quot;Silence Constitutes Consent&quot;. Don&#39;t stay silent about this issue.  Just remember, no matter how hard someone may treat you or how ostracized you are, be proud because you stand out, you are unique, everyone is like the pretty people, they are uniform, they wear masks, they are not special, but you are. And we can&#39;t let special people leave this world. Hell, so many amazing people have been &#39;ugly&#39;; Van Gogh had schizophrenia, Da Vinci was possibly dyslexic, Einstein couldn&#39;t talk till he was 7 years old. But no, we don&#39;t see these people as ugly do we now? The only mask you should wear in life is the one for halloween. :)

Comment: I seen gay. I guess that means I&#39;d be in the hole.<br><br>But, here&#39;s the catch. They&#39;d be writing a fucking list of ugliness all over my mask. So if they organized the holes by category they&#39;d be fucked.<br><br>Depressed, Anxiety, Gay, ADHD, Unemployed, Fat, Gender Fluid, Etc. Bitch can&#39;t label me.

Comment: I literally gasped when they thew that person into that pit. My eyes widened even more when there was blood seeping out of the mask. I took a close look at all the name tags of the &quot;uglies&quot; and came to a realization that this film reflects our current society. A lot of people gate gay people, a lot of people exclude fat people from their groups and etc. When they showed that there were more pits, I was actually a bit scared for some reason. <br>Amazing job, thank you for sharing

Comment: In all honesty, all the things in this short make sense logically, if you take your emotions out of the equation...  From a PURELY Statistical, Scientific, and Logical perspective, it makes sense to do away with them because they will not be the most beneficial for society ... <br><br>Gays, infertile: cannot reproduce therefore no new bodies can come from their existence so why keep them and waste resources ... <br><br>Unemployed, old, handicapped, fat, stupid ex-ex. : Why take care of them if they cannot work like the average human... <br><br>Divorced: It messes with a child&#39;s development more than likely both the man and woman would be thrown in the ditch along with their children because statically a majority of kids in those broken family structures do not do as well. SO with the odds being stacked against an average-above average human why risk the odds and resources the a dysfunctional family unit. <br><br><br>This is the only way to have that &quot;perfect &quot; society where everyone is healthy, feed, and living in complete harmony. This is not a &quot;dystopia&quot; it is a Utopia.<br>Perfect order<br>Peace on Earth<br>No crime<br>No permanent illness<br>No hunger.<br>All because at the end of the day ... all those things in those ditches make up a minority of people on this earth and are not the &quot;average&quot; man. Therefore why waste limited resources on them.<br>Just think about it like the endangered species breeding programs for animals. When an animal is born deformed, weak, ill ex. in those programs they are taken out and gotten rid of because they cannot continue the species in the most beneficial manner.<br><br>To me, this fails at to make me emotional because we do the same thing to animals all the time in programs to keep them alive when they become endangered. With how the earth looks in this to me just looks like a bunch of robots programmed in a time of crisis and near human extinction to keep the human race alive. The robots are doing as robots do thinking without emotion taking out the weak and unbeneficial to society to keep the human race alive and healthy. <br><br>lol and for those of you commenting that this is how religion views society and that&#39;s how we are now you make me laugh ... If anything we are the OPPOSITE of this. A majority of humans value emotion and love above all else. Unfortionalty love leads to passion and deep emotions are unstable in all forms be it Love or Hate. <br>This Video is what would happen if Humans took up a pure Non-Religious,  Science-based government versus the emotional/religious forms that rule our world today. <br>-Science is based on logic and fact. <br>-Religion is based on Beliefs and Emotion. <br>In short, this is the world with no religion those who are not an average or above human specimen are disposed of just like lab rats ‚úß‚Å∫‚∏ú(‚óè‚Ä≤‚ñæ‚Äµ‚óè)‚∏ù‚Å∫‚úß<br><br>AND, yes there is an average health and mentality for a human being from a scientific standpoint just like any living creature on this earth.<br>Show less<br>REPLY

Comment: I&#39;m considered an &quot;ugly&quot; person here. And In real life. Why is it considered ugly to be any of those things in the hole. None of them are actually ugly just different. Learn that it&#39;s not ugly to be who you are. If your gay then show it. If your fat don&#39;t be ashamed. If your disfigured don&#39;t feel horrible. If your deaf/ blind you have a rough life and I applaud you. If your any of those things in the hole. Your not ugly. Your beautiful.

People are DYING AND YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE SUFFERING! just think about life and life isn&#39;t all about being pretty.

Comment: It&#39;s sad this is how society treats each other, I choose not to hear the things people have said but sometimes I can&#39;t help it. Some are &quot;unwanted&quot; in society some are &quot;imperfect&quot; and people see that as bad? No, no one should think this way, so humans weren&#39;t meant to be that way so what? Things change not everyone can fit this <b>perfect</b> picture society has and yet some people can&#39;t see that. They think everyone and everything <b>has</b> to be &quot;perfect&quot; this isn&#39;t good.  Society thinks we&#39;re all normal and that how we should be society sees one <b>TENY</b> <b>TINY</b> imperfection and that imperfection is thrown out, not accepted for what it is. Humans aren&#39;t supposed to be perfect. Humans don&#39;t rule this world. Humans are humans some imperfect some pretty normal, but of course society says the imperfect don&#39;t belong so <b>boom</b> ,gone. This isn&#39;t good for our world yet people still do this even from speeches, messages, videos etc. Some of the &quot;uglies&quot; could be you! Divorced, ugly. Fat, ugly. Sick, ugly. Old, ugly. Gay, <b>ugly</b> !!! This is how we title each other. Maybe this will just be a comment to you maybe not, just make sure you don&#39;t make society&#39;s mistakes.<br><br>~Luna

Comment: So sad, but pretty is subjective terms. Everyone has their own preferences of pretty.<br>But, somehow is being Gay considered not pretty? What I saw, most gays have pretty face. <br>To be honest, in reality there cant be everybody has pretty face, if that happen some group may think they are prettier than others and vice versa. The world need balance. But having pretty face, neighbors and family is something good to have at least you could relax your sight üòä

Comment: The short is good.<br>But the reflection it gives is kinda old, i mean, that stereotype problematic has been turned upside down since like, 2013.<br>Now everyone defends being fat, divorced, gay, old... And being it is not a problem or a tabu at all, i don&#39;t think someone is &quot;ugly&quot; (Obviously metaphorically talking) because of that for the society, specially at this year, 2017.  <br><br>Maybe the problem were the words wrote on the &quot;ugly&quot; people&#39;s masks.<br><br>But, as i said, the short is good, very well done!

Comment: this was such a powerful message to all people

Author: Hi I
Comment: This short is pretty &quot;meh&quot; I&#39;ve seen this type of message of &quot;love everyone all the time no matter what&quot;. And I&#39;ve seen it done better. Also this is pretty clich√© with how the world seems perfect on top but then has a dark side to it. It&#39;s been done many times and is kinda old at this point. But the animation style I liked a lot and the overall design of everything was good.

Comment: I think the message is this: in the future all of us (including robots) will judge each other into right or wrong the hard way worse than segregation and this is how it goes<br>pretty ones are:pretty,pretty,pretty ,and pretty <br>the &quot;ugly&quot; ones that are dead are: unhappy,depressing,gay,divorced,crippiling,&quot;ugly&quot;,blind,deff ,and more<br>we would judge or robots would most likely robots but the world could possibly be a &quot;pretty&quot; world filled only with &quot;pretty&quot; people and that is not going to &quot;pretty&quot;<br>conclusion:don&#39;t judge others by action,looks,what happened in their life ,and dissabilities or else most of us will act like it be like those robots judging other humans as in a life or death situation and wanting the world to be &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; when it really is &quot;ugly&quot; to see the &quot;ugly&quot; ones die and &quot;pretty&quot; ones to live and the population would drop wayy down to hell because that&#39;s also not making the world &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot; so next time you see someone gay or deff or ugly just make shure that they aren&#39;t &quot;ugly&quot; because that&#39;s how they want to live.

This tells you don&#39;t judge a book by its cover, and everyone is &quot;pretty&quot;. I don&#39;t like saying it because it can be taken into affence.

Comment: One thing about this doesn&#39;t make sense to me. When it showed the &quot;ugly&quot; people it showed a woman that had &quot;unemployed&quot; but no other woman had a job and was a house wife so that didn&#39;t really make sense why she&#39;s was ugly

Comment: The animation is good, but the masks are completely useless.<br>Masks are generally meant to hide your identity, but that doesn&#39;t hold up here; everybody has their identifying traits taped to their masks. And since these &quot;ugly&quot; traits ARE just taped to their masks, why don&#39;t they just take them off? How do people even decide who&#39;s &quot;ugly&quot; or not? Are they &quot;ugly&quot; for admitting their &quot;ugliness&quot;? Why would they admit their &quot;ugliness&quot;? Do the &quot;pretties&quot; gather round and vote on who is the least &quot;pretty&quot;? <br>This whole dynamic doesn&#39;t make any sense.

Comment: This is a powerful message of how social media sets standards for people (mostly girl because as a girl it feels that way) how to talk, walk, and act. Its a depressing thought on how the world is not very accepting against the 1% (99%). Be who you are and don&#39;t let social media ruin you! Be yourself (hella original I know) and be that one person who screams in the hallways

Comment: The fact that being actually pretty never mattered, it was how you acted and behaved and lived your life exactly how they wanted you too. Because in the end they all wore the same mask and the thing that separated the &quot;uglies&quot; from the &quot;pretties&quot; was what they did, done or have.  For example one was gay, another was deaf and one was divorced,  making them in there rules, &quot;ugly&quot;.

Comment: It shows that being kids your not really corrupted by society&#39;s standard of &quot;pretty&quot; or being &quot;perfect&quot;. Yet as you grow up your pushed into this ideal that if you don&#39;t fit the certain standard your &quot;ugly&quot;. Although in the end it shows the &quot;broken&quot; people. How those are the ones who are forgotten or hurt. The ones with the scars who are considered &quot;ugly&quot;. But the &quot;ugly&quot; ones and the &quot;pretty&quot; ones both wear masks, because the only person that has perceived their face is the woman at the end. She is the one who decides who is who. She represents society. That&#39;s just how I perceive this whole thing.

Comment: It truly is sad when people try to apply this dystopia to western civilizations like America and Britain. Hell, where I&#39;m from, people wear the fact that their gay on their sleeves, and are none the worse off. Really, the places this cartoon depicts are places like India, and China. I dislike people who complain about western societies, because we are the most welcoming and tolerant ones out there (with a few problems here and there). All in all, great cartoon, (although people like to say the message is deep and complex, it really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s simple and displayed evidently. Although still effective)

Comment: as it said once you&#39;ve raised a family you too will be pretty saying creating unrealistic beauty standards for the youth because traditional this is how everyone should look if you are ugly you will be penalized aka bullying and harsh behavior and the masks only the adults can be seen wearing masks but not the children the children have the ability to whatever they please mess around play with friends express themselves but once you reach adulthood your just like everyone else a boring monotonous life which everybody has so the masks depict everyone to be the same?

Comment: This is such a deep short film. I feel as a society we&#39;ve become so much more open to differences and change. But this paints the world of a dystopia that only wants people to be the &quot;best versions&quot; of themselves. The fact that everyone wears a mask is quite important actually. It 1. Eliminates the possibility of pretty being skin deep(for pretty is described as overall personality/lifestyle) and 2. It shows how nobody is perfect. You&#39;re either changed successfully, or you are deemed flawed, a horrifying thing to be in this particular world. If you&#39;re not straight, happily married, have kids and are skinny, you are not pretty. You cannot live the &quot;perfect&quot; life that has been planned out by society. Only kids can be mask free because who they are has not been determined. This is such a powerful message.

Comment: So not to be a jerk, but what your getting at here is something akin to social Nazism, minus the emphasis on the Jewish people. Two throw my two worthless cents in, It certianly is rather dystopian and I think their is something a bit deeper that your trying to get at here, but frankly I&#39;m a bit to tired to dig to deep...<br><br>Anyway, as I was saying, this sort of Dystopia has been speculated. The whole sort of &quot;if your not prefect your literally dead&quot; scenario. In this case its taken to extremes and as mentioned ealrier has some stereotypical Nazi undertones. <br><br>I dunno, but i just dont see the signs of something like this happeneing, even disregarding the technology needed. And it&#39;s not even i have faith in humanity, because i don&#39;t. Humanity is constantly struggling with it self like an alcoholic who cant stay sober but wants to. Persecution will also happen, even in the most &quot;forward thinking&quot; (whatever the heck that means) nations. But to something on this level would have to appeal more then our greed and our lazinesses. Killing all fat, gay, depressed, etc people would cost alot, and would require a mega shit ton of work.<br><br>Who wants to do that? Even if your a racial purest or whatever. Frankly im more catuois towards people apathy and their inability to be content with less.<br><br>Holy crow, what a rant, apologies to anyone who read this whole thing, whi knows if it even makes sense.

Comment: This was fascinating. The use blank masks on both the &quot;pretties&quot; and &quot;uglies&quot; stablished quickly the idea of &quot;society only sees you as a single thing, a label they can stamp on your forehead&quot;. Even those who are pretty have a single label, they are all pretty. No need to stamp it because if you are pretty everyone can identify you easily. You are pretty, plain and simple.<br><br>Look how the people who are not pretty need another label, they do not fit the norm, as such they cannot be pretty, they are too complicated to be pretty. Pay attention in how the kids are not pretty &quot;yet&quot;, and they wear no mask, even the description in the tv propaganda showed them as multifaceted, they were yet to be defined as pretty or ugly.<br><br>I do wonder what the heck the giant female looking robot is at the end, but other than that, amazing piece.

Comment: This is genius. So true. So sad. <br>Edit: I love this. How children eventually mold into Society&#39;s expectations and wear a mask. Everyone knows their place and those who don&#39;t or have a &#39;defect&#39; are thrown out by society and shunned. There are so many wonderful layers to this short. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s an animation short but it&#39;s message is long lasting.

Comment: Meh. It&#39;s got potential, especially as an early push towards original content, but the worldbuilding&#39;s all stuff that&#39;s been done before and better, and it&#39;s portrayed in a cliched manner. &quot;Cheerful 50&#39;s nuclear family dystopias expositioned about via chipper PSA only to cut away to show the brutality&quot;. Been there, done that. Yawn. I like the murder pits, but it feels like there&#39;s no build up to them, we just skip straight to seeing them because this is a Dystopia and that&#39;s what you do. It&#39;s kind of hard to care about a random pile of bodies with almost no context or connection to the family we just spent the first few minutes with. And what was the point of the giant naked woman machine...? It&#39;s one of those things that looks like it&#39;s meant to be symbolic but just isn&#39;t.

Comment: Love this short. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;d be thrown right into the pit in that universe, but this really spoke to me. Or maybe it&#39;s the masks that just make me connect with this short. Let me elaborate a little.<br><br>I&#39;m autistic, and I feel I sort of have to wear a &#39;mask&#39; even after telling people. I mean, I&#39;m one of those autistic people that would be stamped as &#39;high-functioning&#39;, which makes me come off as if it&#39;s not really impairing me in any way. Don&#39;t get me wrong, autism has its advantages. Who&#39;s got two thumbs and is going to hear something happening before someone without autism, and can thus warn others before it happens? This girl. Who&#39;s going to give you that alternative view on things that you might need, but no neurotypical could offer? Yup, sassy &#39;ol me. When the neurotypical might look at things from angle A, and another looks at it from angle B, I might bring up that angle C which everyone&#39;s been ignoring.<br><br>Anyhow, my point is: people know something&#39;s up with me. But autism is the last thing people would guess on me, and others have been vocal about that a few times. That exact thing is what leaves people even more unconvinced that there&#39;s shit that I simply can&#39;t do. Or it downright bars me from getting help that I legit need, because I don&#39;t appear as someone else&#39;s idea of an autistic person (which is usually Rain Man over where I live). And lord knows a confident, fat, autistic, slightly goth-dressing woman absolutely befuddles people sometimes. <br><br>I&#39;m really tired of wearing the mask of this overly polite, constantly apologetic, never angry autistic woman. Because that&#39;s what i need to do to get anywhere close to the help I need 90% of the time. And then, neurotypicals have the gall to call me oversensitive, while they completely panic the moment they need to turn the light dial back a slight smidge! But lord knows I can&#39;t tell &#39;em that: they&#39;re the ones scorching my sensitive eyes, but I&#39;m in the wrong? Fuck that notion! Preferably with a cactus. And people wonder why I&#39;m pissed off! I shouldn&#39;t have to have trained myself to automatically apologize for stuff my autism does, and go through the fucking dust for help I need. <br><br>Without the mask, I am a really pissed off young woman, who does not apologize for her autism to get help. The autistic woman who cares deeply about her friends, and whose heart breaks while seeing good people mistreated by the same system keeping me down. That makes me the autistic woman who&#39;ll drop your ableist ass like a brick, without a shred of guilt. And go straight to someone who has some goddamn empathy. Because if you believe it&#39;s okay to treat me like that, you obviously are lacking in that department.<br><br>I&#39;d say to the general comments to call me an SJW all you want after this little rant. I still mean it when I say that. But since the mask&#39;s off anyway: I&#39;m just this random Dutch girl with an opinion. I can&#39;t be arsed to care about some random stranger halfway across the world, defending this system forcing me to wear a mask to get help that I legit need. Anyone who thinks me and the people I care about deserve to be treated this way because of shit beyond our control? They can go fuck themselves. And I&#39;m not the least bit sorry for saying that. All I&#39;m sorry for is a long comment. xD

Comment: For those who are confused. The giant figure at the end is a figure of &quot;God&quot; if you read some of the names you&#39;d notice. &quot;Gay, Blind, Fat, Depressed, Old, Divorced&quot; All things that are frowned upon in society. The women are suppose to clean and cook. The men are suppose to be strong and work. The child are suppose to be cheerful and happy. But not all children could show their face, because those children are fake. The masks are a fake reality we have created in our minds. The problem is that, we have a mindset of this nuclear family. A mother, father, two or three children and maybe a dog. Anything else can be frowned upon. This to some people may seem creepy. But it&#39;s the living reality in our world currently.

Comment: I know someone has probably already pointed this out in the comments, but this seems like it may be an allegory for nazi germany. At least, that&#39;s the way I interpret it. Hitler had an racial grouping called the Aryan Race, who ideally had Blond hair, white skin, and blue eyes, and was christan. Ayren was what was considered &quot;pretty&quot;, and children were told that to be a good Ayren, they had to be a member of the hitler youth. Jewish people, Gay People,Cripples, Mentally Disabled People, and Romania People, were considered &quot;Ugly&quot; and &quot;In need of extermination&quot;.

Comment: This video is so deep....It left me wanting more! The world that these people or things live in is just like our reality in a way...&quot;pretty&quot; people are normal and perfect and &quot;uglies&quot; have had something that&#39;s made them different...like being gay, depressed, divorced, fat, old, stupid etc...and these robots or whatever represent the media and just the world in general. They are killing and throwing these &quot;ugly&quot; people into a pit and teaching children of &quot;pretty people&quot; to stay &quot;pretty&quot; and therefore makes them paranoid and judgemental....which is very much like our society we live in now. People will criticize and judge you and metaphorically kill you and throw you into a pit....then come the masks, everybody wore masks except the children...as I noticed, all the &quot;uglies&quot; wore masks and yes, they could be any age. I believe that the &quot;uglies&quot; wore masks that were like the &quot;pretty masks&quot; so they could fit in. On the masks of the &quot;uglies&quot; there are labels, like how society labels us, and on the &quot;pretty&quot; masks there are no labels because they are perfect. Therefore, this video represents how terrible the world is and how children have to live and adapt to this environment...creating the worst society possible.

Comment: This was a nice video with a good message of the society. The &#39;uglies&#39; are abused and not respected,as for the &#39;pretties&#39; they are left alone to be content with their lives and respected. Ugly people have bad lives,while Pretty people get the good lives. Basically this video is sorta like a predicament of the future society. If we stop this nonsense,this wouldn&#39;t happen. So next time you call someone ugly,think about it. &quot;What could this lead to in the future?&quot;

Comment: I think what&#39;s being challenged today is this universal concept of &quot;pretty&quot; pretty is largely defined by the dominant culture. What happens when the genetic makeup of that culture/society changes? Well, the definition of pretty also begins to change. This is what&#39;s happening today all across the world and why there is such a huge divide and strife among it&#39;s citizens. <br><br>A lot of people are talking about how this video is showing how intolerance is the ultimate downfall of us all. And while that is certainly true about intolerance...I feel there is another point being brought up. Who are you to &quot;tolerate&quot; the traits of someone else, what gives you the authority to decide that what you have is &quot;normal&quot; and what they have needs to be &quot;tolerated&quot;? I feel many people haven&#39;t entertained the concept that perhaps THEY are the one&#39;s being tolerated with, and while they struggle with tolerating others....others are successfully tolerating them. <br><br>Because the make up, values, and preferences of society is constantly changing, there is no true pretty. And those who thought themselves to be tolerant yesterday, may find themselves begging for tolerance tomorrow.

Comment: Another propaganda for the &quot;perfect world&quot; because of society. That is the reason why we should rebel the &quot;normal&quot; as we no longer live in the 1950s. I myself is ugly, autistic, and furry. But I don&#39;t give a f@#$ on what &quot;normal&quot; people say about me.<br><br>I will NOT be pretty because of you. Let everyone enjoy the life they love and live comfortably. F*ck you propaganda.

Author: cyber_dragon_123
Comment: The idea of &quot;ugly&quot; people being killed is a paradox in itself. If sexual attraction works by looking for a mate similar to oneself, then everyone is attractive. Therefore, everyone should also be ugly, because at least one person would view them as so.

Comment: Seems like the reason the &quot;pretty&quot; people wear masks is cuz, well, maybe they&#39;re robots? Like, they don&#39;t like the children to be raised by the real parents and be taught ideologies they don&#39;t approve of, so they kill the parents after the children are born, and then send robots in their place. Maybe the mask is so they don&#39;&#39;t recognize them?<br>Just a thought.

Comment: This probably won&#39;t relate to the video that much, but I remember in Anthropology class my teach told us of an experiment that was done by Lombroso. He believed that by taking the looks of criminals, he could find a repeating characteristic, and from there all future criminals could be identified by that characteristic. He layered photos of criminals, and instead of getting one characteristic that stood out, the &quot;Ultimate&quot; criminal looked average. It also became apparent that the more average the person looked the more appealing they looked to others. So if you ever feel bad about being average, just know that you are considered beautiful.

If you feel like you are sad or another feeling t and tell someone do NOT be afraid to hide your feelings... Just tell some one... and you might feel a little better!!!<br><br>(Edit: And make sure that you are ready for the real world...)

Comment: So many people are confused as to why being gay is not considered &quot;pretty&quot;... look at the parents in the beginning of the PSA. They&#39;re pretty heteronormative, conforming to gender roles (the father works, the mother cooks) - which a gay couple would not be able to follow. The &quot;uglies&quot; in the video stands for the unwanted minorities that society dislikes, hence they are all killed off.

Comment: When the body labeled blind, I started crying. I was born with a rough start, rougher than most. I had a stroke during labor, that stroke took away the sight from my right eye, leaving me with half of an average vision. It&#39;s slowly been eating away at my left I for the last 14 years. I have nightmares about waking up one day, not being able to see my little brother, my best friends, my mom and dad. I&#39;m slower at everything, always the last to finish everything like tests or assignments because it takes me much more longer to read things. If you read all this, just remember, the harder the struggle the bigger the triumph

Comment: This is awesome. I thought that the pits with the uglies were really cool (and disturbing). I kinda noticed something too - with the labels on the masks were more like what people saw them as rather than what they are. Like, there was one that said &quot;depressing&quot;. i thought that it was interesting that it didn&#39;t just say &quot;depressed.&quot; I think its because people think of you as depressing and don&#39;t realize its because you&#39;re depressed. I don&#39;t know if it was intentional or not, i just found it interesting

Comment: Intolerance is an awful thing, and can lead to even more horrible things. In this film, anyone who isn&#39;t their idea of what a person is supposed to be like, they throw them out like garbage, while those who are &quot;pretty&quot; must live their lives as this idea. This sort of thing has happened all throughout history, and we are only going to repeat if we don&#39;t learn to not tolerate intolerance. So I say well done on this film, as it clearly states that message.

Comment: I feel really bad for the people who were labeled as Blind or Gay, Divorced, Old,  Depressed, Unemployed,  and more. I was was so speechless, thinking, &quot;does humanity really act or relate to this today?&quot;. I didn&#39;t really even know what to think. I mean, people should accept and try to listen and help people like this, who are gay/lesbian, old, young, deppressed. and everything. This animation is inspiring and really makes you think. Good job, my friend.

I&#39;m gonna show everyone this video and tell them: Our children do not deserve to live in a world like this. Nobody deserves it. NOBODY should be put down for not meeting YOUR standards; everyone deserves the same respect, recognition and opportunities. I was especially angry when a person labeled &#39;gay&#39; was lying among the dead bodies. Nobody deserves a fate like that. Nobody.

Comment: The sad part is that this is actually true, people who are considered &quot;pretty&quot; are the ones who are accepted in society and are loved, people who are considered &quot;ugly&quot;, are discarded, frowned upon and treated like aliens. But in truth, there&#39;s no pretty or ugly, there&#39;s only people and who they are they can&#39;t help if they&#39;re disformed or blind or even deaf. People get pulled into depression because of this and it&#39;s not right, everyone in their own special unique way that can&#39;t be matched, are absolutely drop dead gorgeous. This is what causes a lot of death in the world and it&#39;s just disgusting how people think they have a right to classifying what&#39;s pretty and what&#39;s not. We are all capable of love and we are all beautiful so people should stop thinking about what&#39;s on the outside , they should think about what&#39;s on the inside.

Comment: This really reminds me of a prompt I read in English. It&#39;s in the year 2081 and everyone is equal. If you were beautiful, you wore a ugly mask. If you were strong, you had weights put on you. If you were smart than average, you would wear a earpiece that every 20 seconds or so, a noise would go off disturbing your thoughts. People who were average smart, strong, was untouched. So people who was basically was better at talent, had to wear these handicaps. But it&#39;s really messed up to kill a man who was gay or a girl who was depressed

Comment: I wonder why the adults are wearing masks, and not the two children we see in the video.<br><br>Is it because a child is oblivious to the things in the world? They have big dreams/ideas, and want those dreams/ideas to come true, and always think everyone is happy?<br><br>The adults, they may have to worry about their children, how they&#39;ll be able to take of them (or themselves if they don&#39;t have children), how they need jobs for money to pay for things, you know, adult stuff.<br><br>Or maybe its like the &quot;ugly&quot; people (i&#39;m not saying you people are ugly, you&#39;re perfect the way you are &lt;3 ), and how they&#39;re afraid of what others may see in them? I&#39;m not sure.<br><br><br>(edit: rewatched it, everyone is wearing masks.)

Comment: They define pretty as &quot;normal&quot; and ugly as the variants. It&#39;s a society where they kill you for being different. I suspect that this even applies to gender, due to it following the social construct of &quot;husband goes to work to provide for the family, wife stays home to look after the house and kids&quot;. I bet &quot;tomboy&quot; is one of the labels. <br><br>You know, I just realized, society applied the labels on them haven&#39;t they? They didn&#39;t get to choose.<br><br>My point is, this is a horrible society, and I hope this never happens in real life.

Nice job Guy, it s &quot;pretty&quot; awesome. <br>Dystopia are useful, by seeing what miss in this video, we can understand what&#39;s important on real life. Here it&#39;s the unity, the tolerance who&#39;s totally missed in this world, and who&#39;s important in our all-days-life.<br>And thks again for your awesome work.

Comment: I absolutely love it! It&#39;s like it has a deeper meaning. Like why dislike &#39;&#39;ugly&#39;&#39; people? Why dislike them because they were born with &#39;&#39;ugliness&#39;&#39; or because they obtained the &#39;&#39;ugliness&#39;&#39; somehow? It&#39;s almost like this animation is showing how the &#39;&#39;pretty&#39;&#39; people are really the ugly ones for disliking the ugly ones, hmmh? ;)

Comment: The simple message of &quot;fear the intolerance&quot; is pretty fit given the current state of politics, where radicalism and dangerous ideologies arise from every side of the spectrum. Very nice message indeed, accompanied by this mysterious &quot;retro&quot; aura.<br><br>I beg for a sequel of this one, seems to have a lot of potential.
