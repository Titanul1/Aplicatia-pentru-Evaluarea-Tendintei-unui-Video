@sebasjiannguyen4022,"To everyone who&#39;s studying with this music:<br><br>Checklist: <br>• A bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧<br>• Your charger. You sometimes don&#39;t even notice that your device&#39;s battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋<br>• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it&#39;s a late night study session, you won&#39;t wake up anyone🎧<br>• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕<br>• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨<br>•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, and your pet so you have a study buddy (if you have one)🐈<br><br>Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it&#39;s cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. <br><br>You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that&#39;s even better than listening to music while reading the book. 📖<br><br>I hope y&#39;all had a good day, if not, that&#39;s okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight 😴🧸<br><br>(not mine! but copy paste it around!!)"
